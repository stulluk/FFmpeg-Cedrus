=head1 NAME

ffserver - ffserver video server

=head1 SYNOPSIS


ffserver [I<options>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION


B<ffserver> is a streaming server for both audio and video.
It supports several live feeds, streaming from files and time shifting
on live feeds. You can seek to positions in the past on each live
feed, provided you specify a big enough feed storage.

B<ffserver> is configured through a configuration file, which
is read at startup. If not explicitly specified, it will read from
F</etc/ffserver.conf>.

B<ffserver> receives prerecorded files or FFM streams from some
B<ffmpeg> instance as input, then streams them over
RTP/RTSP/HTTP.

An B<ffserver> instance will listen on some port as specified
in the configuration file. You can launch one or more instances of
B<ffmpeg> and send one or more FFM streams to the port where
ffserver is expecting to receive them. Alternately, you can make
B<ffserver> launch such B<ffmpeg> instances at startup.

Input streams are called feeds, and each one is specified by a
C<E<lt>FeedE<gt>> section in the configuration file.

For each feed you can have different output streams in various
formats, each one specified by a C<E<lt>StreamE<gt>> section in the
configuration file.


=head1 DETAILED DESCRIPTION


B<ffserver> works by forwarding streams encoded by
B<ffmpeg>, or pre-recorded streams which are read from disk.

Precisely, B<ffserver> acts as an HTTP server, accepting POST
requests from B<ffmpeg> to acquire the stream to publish, and
serving RTSP clients or HTTP clients GET requests with the stream
media content.

A feed is an B<FFM> stream created by B<ffmpeg>, and sent to
a port where B<ffserver> is listening.

Each feed is identified by a unique name, corresponding to the name
of the resource published on B<ffserver>, and is configured by
a dedicated C<Feed> section in the configuration file.

The feed publish URL is given by:
	
	http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<http_port>/<feed_name>


where I<ffserver_ip_address> is the IP address of the machine where
B<ffserver> is installed, I<http_port> is the port number of
the HTTP server (configured through the B<HTTPPort> option), and
I<feed_name> is the name of the corresponding feed defined in the
configuration file.

Each feed is associated to a file which is stored on disk. This stored
file is used to allow to send pre-recorded data to a player as fast as
possible when new content is added in real-time to the stream.

A "live-stream" or "stream" is a resource published by
B<ffserver>, and made accessible through the HTTP protocol to
clients.

A stream can be connected to a feed, or to a file. In the first case,
the published stream is forwarded from the corresponding feed
generated by a running instance of B<ffmpeg>, in the second
case the stream is read from a pre-recorded file.

Each stream is identified by a unique name, corresponding to the name
of the resource served by B<ffserver>, and is configured by
a dedicated C<Stream> section in the configuration file.

The stream access HTTP URL is given by:
	
	http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<http_port>/<stream_name>[<options>]


The stream access RTSP URL is given by:
	
	http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<rtsp_port>/<stream_name>[<options>]


I<stream_name> is the name of the corresponding stream defined in
the configuration file. I<options> is a list of options specified
after the URL which affects how the stream is served by
B<ffserver>. I<http_port> and I<rtsp_port> are the HTTP
and RTSP ports configured with the options I<HTTPPort> and
I<RTSPPort> respectively.

In case the stream is associated to a feed, the encoding parameters
must be configured in the stream configuration. They are sent to
B<ffmpeg> when setting up the encoding. This allows
B<ffserver> to define the encoding parameters used by
the B<ffmpeg> encoders.

The B<ffmpeg> B<override_ffserver> commandline option
allows one to override the encoding parameters set by the server.

Multiple streams can be connected to the same feed.

For example, you can have a situation described by the following
graph:
	
	               _________       __________
	              |         |     |          |
	ffmpeg 1 -----| feed 1  |-----| stream 1 |
	    \         |_________|\    |__________|
	     \                    \
	      \                    \   __________
	       \                    \ |          |
	        \                    \| stream 2 |
	         \                    |__________|
	          \
	           \   _________       __________
	            \ |         |     |          |
	             \| feed 2  |-----| stream 3 |
	              |_________|     |__________|
	
	               _________       __________
	              |         |     |          |
	ffmpeg 2 -----| feed 3  |-----| stream 4 |
	              |_________|     |__________|
	
	               _________       __________
	              |         |     |          |
	              | file 1  |-----| stream 5 |
	              |_________|     |__________|




=head2 FFM, FFM2 formats


FFM and FFM2 are formats used by ffserver. They allow storing a wide variety of
video and audio streams and encoding options, and can store a moving time segment
of an infinite movie or a whole movie.

FFM is version specific, and there is limited compatibility of FFM files
generated by one version of ffmpeg/ffserver and another version of
ffmpeg/ffserver. It may work but it is not guaranteed to work.

FFM2 is extensible while maintaining compatibility and should work between
differing versions of tools. FFM2 is the default.


=head2 Status stream


B<ffserver> supports an HTTP interface which exposes the
current status of the server.

Simply point your browser to the address of the special status stream
specified in the configuration file.

For example if you have:
	
	<Stream status.html>
	Format status
	
	# Only allow local people to get the status
	ACL allow localhost
	ACL allow 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255
	</Stream>


then the server will post a page with the status information when
the special stream F<status.html> is requested.


=head2 How do I make it work?


As a simple test, just run the following two command lines where INPUTFILE
is some file which you can decode with ffmpeg:

	
	ffserver -f doc/ffserver.conf &
	ffmpeg -i INPUTFILE http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm


At this point you should be able to go to your Windows machine and fire up
Windows Media Player (WMP). Go to Open URL and enter

	
	    http://<linuxbox>:8090/test.asf


You should (after a short delay) see video and hear audio.

WARNING: trying to stream test1.mpg doesn't work with WMP as it tries to
transfer the entire file before starting to play.
The same is true of AVI files.

You should edit the F<ffserver.conf> file to suit your needs (in
terms of frame rates etc). Then install B<ffserver> and
B<ffmpeg>, write a script to start them up, and off you go.


=head2 What else can it do?


You can replay video from .ffm files that was recorded earlier.
However, there are a number of caveats, including the fact that the
ffserver parameters must match the original parameters used to record the
file. If they do not, then ffserver deletes the file before recording into it.
(Now that I write this, it seems broken).

You can fiddle with many of the codec choices and encoding parameters, and
there are a bunch more parameters that you cannot control. Post a message
to the mailing list if there are some 'must have' parameters. Look in
ffserver.conf for a list of the currently available controls.

It will automatically generate the ASX or RAM files that are often used
in browsers. These files are actually redirections to the underlying ASF
or RM file. The reason for this is that the browser often fetches the
entire file before starting up the external viewer. The redirection files
are very small and can be transferred quickly. [The stream itself is
often 'infinite' and thus the browser tries to download it and never
finishes.]


=head2 Tips


* When you connect to a live stream, most players (WMP, RA, etc) want to
buffer a certain number of seconds of material so that they can display the
signal continuously. However, ffserver (by default) starts sending data
in realtime. This means that there is a pause of a few seconds while the
buffering is being done by the player. The good news is that this can be
cured by adding a '?buffer=5' to the end of the URL. This means that the
stream should start 5 seconds in the past -- and so the first 5 seconds
of the stream are sent as fast as the network will allow. It will then
slow down to real time. This noticeably improves the startup experience.

You can also add a 'Preroll 15' statement into the ffserver.conf that will
add the 15 second prebuffering on all requests that do not otherwise
specify a time. In addition, ffserver will skip frames until a key_frame
is found. This further reduces the startup delay by not transferring data
that will be discarded.


=head2 Why does the ?buffer / Preroll stop working after a time?


It turns out that (on my machine at least) the number of frames successfully
grabbed is marginally less than the number that ought to be grabbed. This
means that the timestamp in the encoded data stream gets behind realtime.
This means that if you say 'Preroll 10', then when the stream gets 10
or more seconds behind, there is no Preroll left.

Fixing this requires a change in the internals of how timestamps are
handled.


=head2 Does the C<?date=> stuff work.


Yes (subject to the limitation outlined above). Also note that whenever you
start ffserver, it deletes the ffm file (if any parameters have changed),
thus wiping out what you had recorded before.

The format of the C<?date=xxxxxx> is fairly flexible. You should use one
of the following formats (the 'T' is literal):

	
	* YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS     (localtime)
	* YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ    (UTC)


You can omit the YYYY-MM-DD, and then it refers to the current day. However
note that B<?date=16:00:00> refers to 16:00 on the current day -- this
may be in the future and so is unlikely to be useful.

You use this by adding the ?date= to the end of the URL for the stream.
For example:   B<http://localhost:8080/test.asf?date=2002-07-26T23:05:00>.


=head1 OPTIONS


All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiplies, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo"
will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.



=head2 Stream specifiers

Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. C<-codec:a:1 ac3> contains the
C<a:1> stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in C<-b:a 128k> matches all audio
streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, C<-codec copy>
or C<-codec: copy> would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index. E.g. C<-threads:1 4> would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.

=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of following: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for subtitle,
'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. If I<stream_index> is given, then it matches
stream number I<stream_index> of this type. Otherwise, it matches all
streams of this type.

=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

If I<stream_index> is given, then it matches the stream with number I<stream_index>
in the program with the id I<program_id>. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the
program.

=item B<#>I<stream_id> B<or i:>I<stream_id>

Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

=item B<m:>I<key>B<[:>I<value>B<]>

Matches streams with the metadata tag I<key> having the specified value. If
I<value> is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.

Note that in B<ffmpeg>, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.

=item B<-loglevel [repeat+]>I<loglevel> B<| -v [repeat+]>I<loglevel>

Set the logging level used by the library.
Adding "repeat+" indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed
to the first line and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be
omitted. "repeat" can also be used alone.
If "repeat" is used alone, and with no prior loglevel set, the default
loglevel will be used. If multiple loglevel parameters are given, using
'repeat' will not change the loglevel.
I<loglevel> is a number or a string containing one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<quiet>

Show nothing at all; be silent.

=item B<panic>

Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as
and assert failure. This is not currently used for anything.

=item B<fatal>

Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely
cannot continue after.

=item B<error>

Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

=item B<warning>

Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

=item B<info>

Show informative messages during processing. This is in addition to
warnings and errors. This is the default value.

=item B<verbose>

Same as C<info>, except more verbose.

=item B<debug>

Show everything, including debugging information.

=back


By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
B<AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR> or B<NO_COLOR>, or can be forced setting
the environment variable B<AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR>.
The use of the environment variable B<NO_COLOR> is deprecated and
will be dropped in a following FFmpeg version.


=item B<-report>

Dump full command line and console output to a file named
C<I<program>-I<YYYYMMDD>-I<HHMMSS>.log> in the current
directory.
This file can be useful for bug reports.
It also implies C<-loglevel verbose>.

Setting the environment variable C<FFREPORT> to any value has the
same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
options will affect the report; options values must be escaped if they
contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see the
``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual). The
following option is recognized:

=over 4


=item B<file>

set the file name to use for the report; C<%p> is expanded to the name
of the program, C<%t> is expanded to a timestamp, C<%%> is expanded
to a plain C<%>

=item B<level>

set the log level

=back


Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not
appear in the report.


=item B<-hide_banner>

Suppress printing banner.

All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build options
and library versions. This option can be used to suppress printing
this information.


=item B<-cpuflags flags (>I<global>B<)>

Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended
for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.
	
	ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...

=item B<-opencl_options options (>I<global>B<)>

Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when
FFmpeg has been compiled with C<--enable-opencl>.

I<options> must be a list of I<key>=I<value> option pairs
separated by ':'. See the ``OpenCL Options'' section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual for the list of supported options.

=back



=head2 AVOptions


These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
B<-help> option. They are separated into two categories:

=over 4


=item B<generic>

These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.

=item B<private>

These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.

=back


For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the B<id3v2_version> private option of the MP3
muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3


All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier
should be attached to them.

Note: the B<-nooption> syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use B<-option 0>/B<-option 1>.

Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
removed soon.


=head2 Main options



=over 4


=item B<-f> I<configfile>

Read configuration file F<configfile>. If not specified it will
read by default from F</etc/ffserver.conf>.


=item B<-n>

Enable no-launch mode. This option disables all the C<Launch>
directives within the various C<E<lt>FeedE<gt>> sections. Since
B<ffserver> will not launch any B<ffmpeg> instances, you
will have to launch them manually.


=item B<-d>

Enable debug mode. This option increases log verbosity, and directs
log messages to stdout. When specified, the B<CustomLog> option
is ignored.

=back



=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX


B<ffserver> reads a configuration file containing global
options and settings for each stream and feed.

The configuration file consists of global options and dedicated
sections, which must be introduced by "E<lt>I<SECTION_NAME>
I<ARGS>E<gt>" on a separate line and must be terminated by a line in
the form "E<lt>/I<SECTION_NAME>E<gt>". I<ARGS> is optional.

Currently the following sections are recognized: B<Feed>,
B<Stream>, B<Redirect>.

A line starting with C<#> is ignored and treated as a comment.

Name of options and sections are case-insensitive.


=head2 ACL syntax

An ACL (Access Control List) specifies the address which are allowed
to access a given stream, or to write a given feed.

It accepts the folling forms

=over 4


=item *

Allow/deny access to I<address>.
	
	ACL ALLOW <address>
	ACL DENY <address>



=item *

Allow/deny access to ranges of addresses from I<first_address> to
I<last_address>.
	
	ACL ALLOW <first_address> <last_address>
	ACL DENY <first_address> <last_address>


=back


You can repeat the ACL allow/deny as often as you like. It is on a per
stream basis. The first match defines the action. If there are no matches,
then the default is the inverse of the last ACL statement.

Thus 'ACL allow localhost' only allows access from localhost.
'ACL deny 1.0.0.0 1.255.255.255' would deny the whole of network 1 and
allow everybody else.


=head2 Global options


=over 4


=item B<HTTPPort> I<port_number>


=item B<Port> I<port_number>


=item B<RTSPPort> I<port_number>


I<HTTPPort> sets the HTTP server listening TCP port number,
I<RTSPPort> sets the RTSP server listening TCP port number.

I<Port> is the equivalent of I<HTTPPort> and is deprecated.

You must select a different port from your standard HTTP web server if
it is running on the same computer.

If not specified, no corresponding server will be created.


=item B<HTTPBindAddress> I<ip_address>


=item B<BindAddress> I<ip_address>


=item B<RTSPBindAddress> I<ip_address>

Set address on which the HTTP/RTSP server is bound. Only useful if you
have several network interfaces.

I<BindAddress> is the equivalent of I<HTTPBindAddress> and is
deprecated.


=item B<MaxHTTPConnections> I<n>

Set number of simultaneous HTTP connections that can be handled. It
has to be defined I<before> the B<MaxClients> parameter,
since it defines the B<MaxClients> maximum limit.

Default value is 2000.


=item B<MaxClients> I<n>

Set number of simultaneous requests that can be handled. Since
B<ffserver> is very fast, it is more likely that you will want
to leave this high and use B<MaxBandwidth>.

Default value is 5.


=item B<MaxBandwidth> I<kbps>

Set the maximum amount of kbit/sec that you are prepared to consume
when streaming to clients.

Default value is 1000.


=item B<CustomLog> I<filename>

Set access log file (uses standard Apache log file format). '-' is the
standard output.

If not specified B<ffserver> will produce no log.

In case the commandline option B<-d> is specified this option is
ignored, and the log is written to standard output.


=item B<NoDaemon>

Set no-daemon mode. This option is currently ignored since now
B<ffserver> will always work in no-daemon mode, and is
deprecated.

=back



=head2 Feed section


A Feed section defines a feed provided to B<ffserver>.

Each live feed contains one video and/or audio sequence coming from an
B<ffmpeg> encoder or another B<ffserver>. This sequence
may be encoded simultaneously with several codecs at several
resolutions.

A feed instance specification is introduced by a line in the form:
	
	<Feed FEED_FILENAME>


where I<FEED_FILENAME> specifies the unique name of the FFM stream.

The following options are recognized within a Feed section.


=over 4


=item B<File> I<filename>


=item B<ReadOnlyFile> I<filename>

Set the path where the feed file is stored on disk.

If not specified, the F</tmp/FEED.ffm> is assumed, where
I<FEED> is the feed name.

If B<ReadOnlyFile> is used the file is marked as read-only and
it will not be deleted or updated.


=item B<Truncate>

Truncate the feed file, rather than appending to it. By default
B<ffserver> will append data to the file, until the maximum
file size value is reached (see B<FileMaxSize> option).


=item B<FileMaxSize> I<size>

Set maximum size of the feed file in bytes. 0 means unlimited. The
postfixes C<K> (2^10), C<M> (2^20), and C<G> (2^30) are
recognized.

Default value is 5M.


=item B<Launch> I<args>

Launch an B<ffmpeg> command when creating B<ffserver>.

I<args> must be a sequence of arguments to be provided to an
B<ffmpeg> instance. The first provided argument is ignored, and
it is replaced by a path with the same dirname of the B<ffserver>
instance, followed by the remaining argument and terminated with a
path corresponding to the feed.

When the launched process exits, B<ffserver> will launch
another program instance.

In case you need a more complex B<ffmpeg> configuration,
e.g. if you need to generate multiple FFM feeds with a single
B<ffmpeg> instance, you should launch B<ffmpeg> by hand.

This option is ignored in case the commandline option B<-n> is
specified.


=item B<ACL> I<spec>

Specify the list of IP address which are allowed or denied to write
the feed. Multiple ACL options can be specified.

=head2 Stream section


A Stream section defines a stream provided by B<ffserver>, and
identified by a single name.

The stream is sent when answering a request containing the stream
name.

A stream section must be introduced by the line:
	
	<Stream STREAM_NAME>


where I<STREAM_NAME> specifies the unique name of the stream.

The following options are recognized within a Stream section.

Encoding options are marked with the I<encoding> tag, and they are
used to set the encoding parameters, and are mapped to libavcodec
encoding options. Not all encoding options are supported, in
particular it is not possible to set encoder private options. In order
to override the encoding options specified by B<ffserver>, you
can use the B<ffmpeg> B<override_ffserver> commandline
option.

Only one of the B<Feed> and B<File> options should be set.


=over 4


=item B<Feed> I<feed_name>

Set the input feed. I<feed_name> must correspond to an existing
feed defined in a C<Feed> section.

When this option is set, encoding options are used to setup the
encoding operated by the remote B<ffmpeg> process.


=item B<File> I<filename>

Set the filename of the pre-recorded input file to stream.

When this option is set, encoding options are ignored and the input
file content is re-streamed as is.


=item B<Format> I<format_name>

Set the format of the output stream.

Must be the name of a format recognized by FFmpeg. If set to
B<status>, it is treated as a status stream.


=item B<InputFormat> I<format_name>

Set input format. If not specified, it is automatically guessed.


=item B<Preroll> I<n>

Set this to the number of seconds backwards in time to start. Note that
most players will buffer 5-10 seconds of video, and also you need to allow
for a keyframe to appear in the data stream.

Default value is 0.


=item B<StartSendOnKey>

Do not send stream until it gets the first key frame. By default
B<ffserver> will send data immediately.


=item B<MaxTime> I<n>

Set the number of seconds to run. This value set the maximum duration
of the stream a client will be able to receive.

A value of 0 means that no limit is set on the stream duration.

=head1 SYNTAX


This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.



=head2 Quoting and escaping


FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:


=over 4


=item *

C<'> and C<\> are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.


=item *

A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a '\'.


=item *

All characters enclosed between '' are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character C<'> itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.


=item *

Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.

=back


Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.

The function C<av_get_token> defined in
F<libavutil/avstring.h> can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.

The tool F<tools/ffescape> in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Escape the string C<Crime d'Amour> containing the C<'> special
character:
	
	Crime d\'Amour



=item *

The string above contains a quote, so the C<'> needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
	
	'Crime d'\''Amour'



=item *

Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
	
	'  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '



=item *

Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
	
	' The string '\'string\'' is a string '



=item *

To include a literal C<\> you can use either escaping or quoting:
	
	'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo


=back




=head2 Date


The accepted syntax is:
	
	[(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
	now


If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as UTC.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.



=head2 Time duration


There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.

	
	[-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]


I<HH> expresses the number of hours, I<MM> the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and I<SS> the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The I<m> at the end expresses decimal value for
I<SS>.

I<or>

	
	[-]<S>+[.<m>...]


I<S> expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
I<m>.

In both expressions, the optional B<-> indicates negative duration.


=head3 Examples


The following examples are all valid time duration:


=over 4


=item B<55>

55 seconds


=item B<12:03:45>

12 hours, 03 minutes and 45 seconds


=item B<23.189>

23.189 seconds

=head2 Video rate


Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
I<frame_rate_num>/I<frame_rate_den>, an integer number, a float
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation.

=head2 Ratio


A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
I<numerator>:I<denominator>.

Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
considered valid, so you should check on the returned value if you
want to exclude those values.

The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.



=head2 Color


It can be the name of a color as defined below (case insensitive match) or a
C<[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]> sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string
representing the alpha component.

The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the opacity value (B<0x00> or B<0.0> means completely
transparent, B<0xff> or B<1.0> completely opaque). If the alpha
component is not specified then B<0xff> is assumed.

The string B<random> will result in a random color.

=head2 Channel Layout


A channel layout specifies the spatial disposition of the channels in
a multi-channel audio stream. To specify a channel layout, FFmpeg
makes use of a special syntax.

Individual channels are identified by an id, as given by the table
below:

A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by
'+' or '|'. Each term can be:

=over 4


=item *

the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. B<mono>,
B<stereo>, B<4.0>, B<quad>, B<5.0>, etc.)


=item *

the name of a single channel (e.g. B<FL>, B<FR>, B<FC>, B<LFE>, etc.)


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, optionally followed by 'c', yielding
the default channel layout for that number of channels (see the
function C<av_get_default_channel_layout>)


=item *

a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x" (see the
C<AV_CH_*> macros in F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.

=back


Starting from libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to
specify a number of channels will be required, while a channel layout
mask could also be specified as a decimal number (if and only if not
followed by "c").

See also the function C<av_get_channel_layout> defined in
F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.


=head1 EXPRESSION EVALUATION


When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the F<libavutil/eval.h>
interface.

An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.

Two expressions I<expr1> and I<expr2> can be combined to form
another expression "I<expr1>;I<expr2>".
I<expr1> and I<expr2> are evaluated in turn, and the new
expression evaluates to the value of I<expr2>.

The following binary operators are available: C<+>, C<->,
C<*>, C</>, C<^>.

The following unary operators are available: C<+>, C<->.

The following functions are available:

=over 4


=item B<abs(x)>

equal to I<max>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<bitand(x, y)>


=item B<bitor(x, y)>

Compute bitwise and/or operation on I<x> and I<y>.

The results of the evaluation of I<x> and I<y> are converted to
integers before executing the bitwise operation.

Note that both the conversion to integer and the conversion back to
floating point can lose precision. Beware of unexpected results for
large numbers (usually 2^53 and larger).

I<y> are 0 or either or both are less than zero then behavior is undefined.


=item B<gt(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is greater than I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<gte(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is greater than or equal to I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<hypot(x, y)>

This function is similar to the C function with the same name; it returns
"sqrt(I<x>*I<x> + I<y>*I<y>)", the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with sides of length I<x> and I<y>, or the distance of the
point (I<x>, I<y>) from the origin.


=item B<if(x, y)>

Evaluate I<x>, and if the result is non-zero return the result of
the evaluation of I<y>, return 0 otherwise.

=item B<lt(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is lesser than I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<lte(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is lesser than or equal to I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<max(x, y)>

I<l> is not specified then a default log level is used.
Returns the value of the expression printed.

=item B<random(x)>

Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. I<x> is the index of the
internal variable which will be used to save the seed/state.


=item B<root(expr, max)>

Find an input value for which the function represented by I<expr>
with argument I<ld(0)> is 0 in the interval 0..I<max>.

The expression in I<expr> must denote a continuous function or the
result is undefined.

I<ld(0)> is used to represent the function input value, which means
that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(0)>. When the expression evaluates to 0 then the
corresponding input value will be returned.


=item B<sin(x)>

Compute sine of I<x>.


=item B<sinh(x)>

Compute hyperbolic sine of I<x>.


=item B<sqrt(expr)>

Compute the square root of I<expr>. This is equivalent to
"(I<expr>)^.5".


=item B<squish(x)>

Compute expression C<1/(1 + exp(4*x))>.


=item B<st(var, expr)>

Allow to store the value of the expression I<expr> in an internal
variable. I<var> specifies the number of the variable where to
store the value, and it is a value ranging from 0 to 9. The function
returns the value stored in the internal variable.
Note, Variables are currently not shared between expressions.


=item B<tan(x)>

Compute tangent of I<x>.


=item B<tanh(x)>

Compute hyperbolic tangent of I<x>.


=item B<taylor(expr, x)>


=item B<taylor(expr, x, id)>

Evaluate a Taylor series at I<x>, given an expression representing
the C<ld(id)>-th derivative of a function at 0.

When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

I<ld(id)> is used to represent the derivative order in I<expr>,
which means that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times
with various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(id)>. If I<id> is not specified then 0 is assumed.

Note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0,
C<taylor(expr, x-y)> can be used.


=item B<time(0)>

Return the current (wallclock) time in seconds.


=item B<trunc(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> towards zero to the nearest
integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".


=item B<while(cond, expr)>

Evaluate expression I<expr> while the expression I<cond> is
non-zero, and returns the value of the last I<expr> evaluation, or
NAN if I<cond> was always false.

=back


The following constants are available:

=over 4


=item B<PI>

area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

=item B<E>

exp(1) (Euler's number), approximately 2.718

=item B<PHI>

golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2, approximately 1.618

=back


Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
value, note that:

C<*> works like AND

C<+> works like OR

For example the construct:
	
	if (A AND B) then C

is equivalent to:
	
	if(A*B, C)


In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.

The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB',
'G' and 'B' as number postfix.

The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

to set the options for the global OpenCL context.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4

which can be obtained with C<ffmpeg -opencl_bench> or C<av_opencl_get_device_list()>.


=item B<device_idx>

Select the index of the device used to run OpenCL code.

The specified index must be one of the indexes in the device list which
can be obtained with C<ffmpeg -opencl_bench> or C<av_opencl_get_device_list()>.


=back




=head1 CODEC OPTIONS


libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.

Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be unsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVCodecContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follow:


=over 4


=item B<b> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio,video>B<)>

Decoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the decoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native decoders
are enabled by default. Decoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding C<--enable-lib> option. You can list all
available decoders using the configure option C<--list-decoders>.

You can disable all the decoders with the configure option
C<--disable-decoders> and selectively enable / disable single decoders
with the options C<--enable-decoder=I<DECODER>> /
C<--disable-decoder=I<DECODER>>.

The option C<-decoders> of the ff* tools will display the list of

libopencore-amrnb allows libavcodec to decode the Adaptive Multi-Rate
Narrowband audio codec. Using it requires the presence of the
libopencore-amrnb headers and library during configuration. You need to
explicitly configure the build with C<--enable-libopencore-amrnb>.

An FFmpeg native decoder for AMR-NB exists, so users can decode AMR-NB
without this library.


=head2 libopencore-amrwb


libopencore-amrwb decoder wrapper.

libopencore-amrwb allows libavcodec to decode the Adaptive Multi-Rate
Wideband audio codec. Using it requires the presence of the
libopencore-amrwb headers and library during configuration. You need to
explicitly configure the build with C<--enable-libopencore-amrwb>.

An FFmpeg native decoder for AMR-WB exists, so users can decode AMR-WB
without this library.


=head2 libopus


libopus decoder wrapper.

libopus allows libavcodec to decode the Opus Interactive Audio Codec.
Requires the presence of the libopus headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libopus>.

An FFmpeg native decoder for Opus exists, so users can decode Opus
without this library.



=head1 SUBTITLES DECODERS



=head2 dvdsub


This codec decodes the bitmap subtitles used in DVDs; the same subtitles can
also be found in VobSub file pairs and in some Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<palette>

Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps. When stored in VobSub, the
palette is normally specified in the index file; in Matroska, the palette is
stored in the codec extra-data in the same format as in VobSub. In DVDs, the
palette is stored in the IFO file, and therefore not available when reading
from dumped VOB files.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal
numbers (without 0x prefix) separated by comas, for example C<0d00ee,
ee450d, 101010, eaeaea, 0ce60b, ec14ed, ebff0b, 0d617a, 7b7b7b, d1d1d1,
7b2a0e, 0d950c, 0f007b, cf0dec, cfa80c, 7c127b>.

=back



=head2 libzvbi-teletext


Libzvbi allows libavcodec to decode DVB teletext pages and DVB teletext
subtitles. Requires the presence of the libzvbi headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libzvbi>.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<txt_page>

List of teletext page numbers to decode. You may use the special * string to
match all pages. Pages that do not match the specified list are dropped.
Default value is *.

=item B<txt_chop_top>

Discards the top teletext line. Default value is 1.

=item B<txt_format>

Specifies the format of the decoded subtitles. The teletext decoder is capable
of decoding the teletext pages to bitmaps or to simple text, you should use
"bitmap" for teletext pages, because certain graphics and colors cannot be
expressed in simple text. You might use "text" for teletext based subtitles if
your application can handle simple text based subtitles. Default value is
bitmap.

=item B<txt_left>

X offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

=item B<txt_top>

Y offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

=item B<txt_chop_spaces>

Chops leading and trailing spaces and removes empty lines from the generated
text. This option is useful for teletext based subtitles where empty spaces may
be present at the start or at the end of the lines or empty lines may be
present between the subtitle lines because of double-sized teletext charactes.
Default value is 1.

=item B<txt_duration>

Sets the display duration of the decoded teletext pages or subtitles in
miliseconds. Default value is 30000 which is 30 seconds.

=item B<txt_transparent>

Force transparent background of the generated teletext bitmaps. Default value
is 0 which means an opaque (black) background.

=back



=head1 ENCODERS


Encoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the encoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native encoders
are enabled by default. Encoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding C<--enable-lib> option. You can list all
available encoders using the configure option C<--list-encoders>.

You can disable all the encoders with the configure option
C<--disable-encoders> and selectively enable / disable single encoders
with the options C<--enable-encoder=I<ENCODER>> /
C<--disable-encoder=I<ENCODER>>.

The option C<-encoders> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled encoders.



=head1 AUDIO ENCODERS


A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.



=head2 aac


Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is an experimental FFmpeg-native AAC encoder. Currently only the
low complexity (AAC-LC) profile is supported. To use this encoder, you must set
B<strict> option to B<experimental> or lower.

As this encoder is experimental, unexpected behavior may exist from time to
time. For a more stable AAC encoder, see B<libvo-aacenc>. However, be warned
that it has a worse quality reported by some users.

See also B<libfdk_aac>.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<b>

Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode.


=item B<q>

Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool. For library interface users, use
B<global_quality>.


=item B<stereo_mode>

Set stereo encoding mode. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Automatically selected by the encoder.


=item B<ms_off>

Disable middle/side encoding. This is the default.


=item B<ms_force>

Force middle/side encoding.

=back



=item B<aac_coder>

Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<faac>

FAAC-inspired method.

This method is a simplified reimplementation of the method used in FAAC, which
sets thresholds proportional to the band energies, and then decreases all the
thresholds with quantizer steps to find the appropriate quantization with
distortion below threshold band by band.

The quality of this method is comparable to the two loop searching method
described below, but somewhat a little better and slower.


=item B<anmr>

Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This has a theoretic best quality out of all the coding methods, but at the
cost of the slowest speed.


=item B<twoloop>

Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.

This method produces similar quality with the FAAC method and is the default.


=item B<fast>

Constant quantizer method.

This method sets a constant quantizer for all bands. This is the fastest of all
the methods, yet produces the worst quality.


=back



=back



=head2 ac3 and ac3_fixed


AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The I<ac3> encoder uses floating-point math, while the I<ac3_fixed>
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The I<ac3_fixed> encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option C<-acodec ac3_fixed> in order to use it.


=head3 AC-3 Metadata


The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

=item B<-mixing_level> I<number>

Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be
used if the Audio Production Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore,
if the C<room_type> option is not the default value, the C<mixing_level>
option must not be -1.


=item B<-room_type> I<type>

Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing session at
the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a dubbing stage with the
industry standard X-curve equalization; a small room has flat equalization.

=item B<-dialnorm> I<value>

Dialogue Normalization. Indicates how far the average dialogue level of the
program is below digital 100% full scale (0 dBFS). This parameter determines a
level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.


=item B<-dsur_mode> I<mode>

=head3 Extended Bitstream Information

The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream Syntax as
specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped into 2 parts.
If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values in that group will be
written to the bitstream.  Default values are used for those that are written
but have not been specified.  If the mixing levels are written, the decoder
will use these values instead of the ones specified in the C<center_mixlev>
and C<surround_mixlev> options if it supports the Alternate Bit Stream
Syntax.

=item B<global_quality>

Set quality in VBR mode as an integer number of lambda units.

Only relevant when VBR mode is enabled with C<flags +qscale>.  The
value is converted to QP units by dividing it by C<FF_QP2LAMBDA>,
and used to set the quality value used by libfaac. A reasonable range
for the option value in QP units is [10-500], the higher the value the
higher the quality.


=item B<q (>I<-q>B<)>

Enable VBR mode when set to a non-negative value, and set constant
quality value as a double floating point value in QP units.

The value sets the quality value used by libfaac. A reasonable range

=head2 libfdk_aac


libfdk-aac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer FDK AAC code from
the Android project.

Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libfdk-aac>. The library is also incompatible with GPL,
so if you allow the use of GPL, you should configure with
C<--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libfdk-aac>.

This encoder is considered to be of higher quality with respect to
both B<the native experimental FFmpeg AAC encoder> and
B<libfaac>.

VBR encoding, enabled through the B<vbr> or B<flags
+qscale> options, is experimental and only works with some
combinations of parameters.

Support for encoding 7.1 audio is only available with libfdk-aac 0.1.3 or

expressed in kilobits/s.


=item B<q (>I<-V>B<)>

Set constant quality setting for VBR. This option is valid only
using the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool. For library interface
users, use B<global_quality>.


=item B<compression_level (>I<-q>B<)>

Set algorithm quality. Valid arguments are integers in the 0-9 range,
with 0 meaning highest quality but slowest, and 9 meaning fastest
while producing the worst quality.

=head2 libshine


Shine Fixed-Point MP3 encoder wrapper.

Shine is a fixed-point MP3 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.

The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/projects/libshine-fxp/>E<gt>. We only support the
updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at E<lt>B<https://github.com/savonet/shine>E<gt>.

Requires the presence of the libshine headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libshine>.

For more information about the libtheora project see
E<lt>B<http://www.theora.org/>E<gt>.


=head3 Options


The following global options are mapped to internal libtheora options
which affect the quality and the bitrate of the encoded stream.


=over 4


=item B<b>

Set the video bitrate in bit/s for CBR (Constant Bit Rate) mode.  In
case VBR (Variable Bit Rate) mode is enabled this option is ignored.


=item B<flags>

Used to enable constant quality mode (VBR) encoding through the
B<qscale> flag, and to enable the C<pass1> and C<pass2>
modes.


=item B<g>

Set the GOP size.


=item B<global_quality>

Set the global quality as an integer in lambda units.

Only relevant when VBR mode is enabled with C<flags +qscale>. The
value is converted to QP units by dividing it by C<FF_QP2LAMBDA>,
clipped in the [0 - 10] range, and then multiplied by 6.3 to get a
value in the native libtheora range [0-63]. A higher value corresponds
to a higher quality.


=item B<q>

Enable VBR mode when set to a non-negative value, and set constant
quality value as a double floating point value in QP units.

The value is clipped in the [0-10] range, and then multiplied by 6.3
to get a value in the native libtheora range [0-63].

This option is valid only using the B<ffmpeg> command-line
tool. For library interface users, use B<global_quality>.

=head2 libwebp


libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.


=head3 Pixel Format


Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<-lossless> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.


=item B<-compression_level> I<integer>

For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the I<method> option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.


=item B<-qscale> I<float>

For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
I<global_quality> and must be multiplied by I<FF_QP2LAMBDA>.


=item B<-preset> I<type>

Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do not use a preset.

=item B<default>

=head2 libx264, libx264rgb


x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libx264>.

libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC
entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the B<x264opts> and B<x264-params>
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 C<x264_param_parse> function.

The x264 project website is at
E<lt>B<http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html>E<gt>.

The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed RGB
pixel formats as input instead of YUV.


=head3 Supported Pixel Formats


x264 supports 8- to 10-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time. FFmpeg only supports one bit depth in one particular
build. In other words, it is not possible to build one FFmpeg with multiple
versions of x264 with different bit depths.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
B<x264>-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.

To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options
and some others requiring special attention are documented here. For
the documentation of the undocumented generic options, see
B<the Codec Options chapter>.

=item B<x264opts (N.A.)>

Set any x264 option, see B<x264 --fullhelp> for a list.

Argument is a list of I<key>=I<value> couples separated by
":". In I<filter> and I<psy-rd> options that use ":" as a separator
themselves, use "," instead. They accept it as well since long ago but this
is kept undocumented for some reason.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i foo.mpg -vcodec libx264 -x264opts keyint=123:min-keyint=20 -an out.mkv



=item B<x264-params (N.A.)>

Override the x264 configuration using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters.

This option is functionally the same as the B<x264opts>, but is
duplicated for compatibility with the Libav fork.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v libx264 -x264-params level=30:bframes=0:weightp=0:\
	cabac=0:ref=1:vbv-maxrate=768:vbv-bufsize=2000:analyse=all:me=umh:\
	no-fast-pskip=1:subq=6:8x8dct=0:trellis=0 OUTPUT


=back


Encoding ffpresets for common usages are provided so they can be used with the
general presets system (e.g. passing the B<pre> option).


=head2 libxvid


Xvid MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl>.

The native C<mpeg4> encoder supports the MPEG-4 Part 2 format, so
users can encode to this format without this library.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libxvid wrapper. Some of
the following options are listed but are not documented, and
correspond to shared codec options. See B<the Codec
Options chapter> for their documentation. The other shared options
which are not listed have no effect for the libxvid encoder.

Set structural similarity (SSIM) displaying method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<off>

Disable displaying of SSIM information.


=item B<avg>

showing the average SSIM is:

	
	Average SSIM: %f


For users who are not familiar with C, %f means a float number, or
a decimal (e.g. 0.939232).


=item B<frame>

Output both per-frame SSIM data during encoding and average SSIM at
the end of encoding to stdout. The format of per-frame information
is:

	
	       SSIM: avg: %1.3f min: %1.3f max: %1.3f


For users who are not familiar with C, %1.3f means a float number
rounded to 3 digits after the dot (e.g. 0.932).


=back



=item B<ssim_acc>

Set SSIM accuracy. Valid options are integers within the range of
0-4, while 0 gives the most accurate result and 4 computes the
fastest.

=head2 ProRes


Apple ProRes encoder.

FFmpeg contains 2 ProRes encoders, the prores-aw and prores-ks encoder.
The used encoder can be chosen with the C<-vcodec> option.


=head3 Private Options for prores-ks



=over 4


=item B<profile> I<integer>

=item B<default>


=item B<proxy>


=item B<lt>


=item B<standard>


=item B<hq>

If not set, the matrix providing the highest quality, I<default>, will be
picked.


=item B<bits_per_mb> I<integer>

How many bits to allot for coding one macroblock. Different profiles use
between 200 and 2400 bits per macroblock, the maximum is 8000.


=item B<mbs_per_slice> I<integer>

Number of macroblocks in each slice (1-8); the default value (8)
should be good in almost all situations.


=item B<vendor> I<string>

Override the 4-byte vendor ID.
A custom vendor ID like I<apl0> would claim the stream was produced by
the Apple encoder.


=item B<alpha_bits> I<integer>

Specify number of bits for alpha component.
Possible values are I<0>, I<8> and I<16>.
Use I<0> to disable alpha plane coding.


=back



=head3 Speed considerations


In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produc frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher B<bits_per_mb> limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the B<qscale> parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.



=head1 SUBTITLES ENCODERS



=head2 dvdsub


This codec encodes the bitmap subtitle format that is used in DVDs.
Typically they are stored in VOBSUB file pairs (*.idx + *.sub),
and they can also be used in Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<even_rows_fix>

When set to 1, enable a work-around that makes the number of pixel rows
even in all subtitles.  This fixes a problem with some players that
cut off the bottom row if the number is odd.  The work-around just adds
a fully transparent row if needed.  The overhead is low, typically
one byte per subtitle on average.

By default, this work-around is disabled.

=back



=head1 BITSTREAM FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported bitstream
filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
the configure option C<--list-bsfs>.

You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
C<--disable-bsfs>, and selectively enable any bitstream filter using
the option C<--enable-bsf=BSF>, or you can disable a particular
bitstream filter using the option C<--disable-bsf=BSF>.

The option C<-bsfs> of the ff* tools will display the list of
all the supported bitstream filters included in your build.

Below is a description of the currently available bitstream filters.


=head2 aac_adtstoasc


Convert MPEG-2/4 AAC ADTS to MPEG-4 Audio Specific Configuration
bitstream filter.

This filter creates an MPEG-4 AudioSpecificConfig from an MPEG-2/4
ADTS header and removes the ADTS header.

This is required for example when copying an AAC stream from a raw
ADTS AAC container to a FLV or a MOV/MP4 file.


=head2 chomp


Remove zero padding at the end of a packet.


=head2 dump_extra


Add extradata to the beginning of the filtered packets.

The additional argument specifies which packets should be filtered.
It accepts the values:

=over 4


=item B<a>

add extradata to all key packets, but only if I<local_header> is
set in the B<flags2> codec context field


=item B<k>

add extradata to all key packets


=item B<e>

add extradata to all packets

=back


If not specified it is assumed B<k>.

For example the following B<ffmpeg> command forces a global
header (thus disabling individual packet headers) in the H.264 packets
generated by the C<libx264> encoder, but corrects them by adding
the header stored in extradata to the key packets:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -flags:v +global_header -c:v libx264 -bsf:v dump_extra out.ts



=head2 h264_mp4toannexb


Convert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format ("mpegts").

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an H.264 stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts



=head2 imxdump


Modifies the bitstream to fit in MOV and to be usable by the Final Cut
Pro decoder. This filter only applies to the mpeg2video codec, and is
likely not needed for Final Cut Pro 7 and newer with the appropriate
B<-tag:v>.

For example, to remux 30 MB/sec NTSC IMX to MOV:

	
	ffmpeg -i input.mxf -c copy -bsf:v imxdump -tag:v mx3n output.mov



=head2 mjpeg2jpeg


Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a
JPEG image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss,
e.g. by

	
	ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg


Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because
they lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
E<lt>B<http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml>E<gt>:

Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the
MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* --
Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2,
and it must use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or
progressive. . . . You can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and
decode them with a regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend
the DHT segment to them, or else the decoder won't have any idea
how to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given in
the OpenDML spec."

This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an MJPEG
stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
produce fully qualified JPEG images.

	
	ffmpeg -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
	exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
	ffmpeg -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi



=head2 mjpega_dump_header



=head2 movsub



=head2 mp3_header_decompress



=head2 noise


Damages the contents of packets without damaging the container. Can be
used for fuzzing or testing error resilience/concealment.

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf noise output.mkv



=head2 remove_extra



=head1 FORMAT OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the muxers and demuxers. In addition each muxer or
demuxer may support so-called private options, which are specific for
that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<avioflags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Possible values:

Reduce buffering.

=back



=item B<probesize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set probing size in bytes, i.e. the size of the data to analyze to get
stream information. A higher value will allow to detect more
information in case it is dispersed into the stream, but will increase
latency. Must be an integer not lesser than 32. It is 5000000 by default.


=item B<packetsize> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set packet size.


=item B<fflags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Allow seeking to non-keyframes on demuxer level when supported if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<analyzeduration> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specify how many microseconds are analyzed to probe the input. A
higher value will allow to detect more accurate information, but will
increase latency. It defaults to 5,000,000 microseconds = 5 seconds.


=item B<cryptokey> I<hexadecimal string> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set decryption key.


=item B<indexmem> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set size in bytes for each chunk.


=item B<err_detect, f_err_detect> I<flags> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set error detection flags. C<f_err_detect> is deprecated and
should be used only via the B<ffmpeg> tool.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<crccheck>

Verify embedded CRCs.

=item B<bitstream>

Detect bitstream specification deviations.

Shift timestamps so that the first timestamp is 0.

=item B<auto (default)>

Enables shifting when required by the target format.

=item B<disabled>

=back


When shifting is enabled, all output timestamps are shifted by the
same amount. Audio, video, and subtitles desynching and relative
timestamp differences are preserved compared to how they would have
been without shifting.


=item B<skip_initial_bytes> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set number of bytes to skip before reading header and frames if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<correct_ts_overflow> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Correct single timestamp overflows if set to 1. Default is 1.


=item B<flush_packets> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Flush the underlying I/O stream after each packet. Default 1 enables it, and
has the effect of reducing the latency; 0 disables it and may slightly
increase performance in some cases.


=item B<output_ts_offset> I<offset> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the output time offset.

I<offset> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

The offset is added by the muxer to the output timestamps.

Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are
delayed bt the time duration specified in I<offset>. Default value
is C<0> (meaning that no offset is applied).

=back





=head2 Format stream specifiers


Format stream specifiers allow selection of one or more streams that
match specific properties.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index.


=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of following: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio,
's' for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. If
I<stream_index> is given, then it matches the stream number
I<stream_index> of this type. Otherwise, it matches all streams of
this type.


=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

If I<stream_index> is given, then it matches the stream with number
I<stream_index> in the program with the id
I<program_id>. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the program.


=item B<#>I<stream_id>

Matches the stream by a format-specific ID.

=back


The exact semantics of stream specifiers is defined by the
C<avformat_match_stream_specifier()> function declared in the
F<libavformat/avformat.h> header.


=head1 DEMUXERS


Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option C<--list-demuxers>.

You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
C<--disable-demuxers>, and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option C<--enable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>, or disable it
with the option C<--disable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>.

The option C<-formats> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers.

The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.


=head2 applehttp


Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is
available in a metadata key named "variant_bitrate".


=head2 asf


Advanced Systems Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux ASF files and MMS network streams.


=over 4


=item B<-no_resync_search> I<bool>

Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.

=back




=head2 concat


Virtual concatenation script demuxer.

This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packet had been muxed
together.

The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.

All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).

The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
C<duration> directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.


=head3 Syntax


The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:


=over 4



=item B<C<file I<path>>>

Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.

All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.


=item B<C<ffconcat version 1.0>>

Identify the script type and version. It also sets the B<safe> option
to 1 if it was to its default -1.

To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appears exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.


=item B<C<duration I<dur>>>

Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.

If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.


=item B<C<stream>>

Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
stream.
Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the
matching streams in the subfiles.
If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.


=item B<C<exact_stream_id I<id>>>

Set the id of the stream.
If this directive is given, the string with the corresponding id in the
subfiles will be used.
This is especially useful for MPEG-PS (VOB) files, where the order of the
streams is not reliable.


=back



=head3 Options


This demuxer accepts the following option:


=over 4



=item B<safe>

If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths. A file path is considered safe if it
does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components
only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits,
period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a
component.

If set to 0, any file name is accepted.

The default is -1, it is equivalent to 1 if the format was automatically
probed and 0 otherwise.


=item B<auto_convert>

If set to 1, try to perform automatic conversions on packet data to make the
streams concatenable.

Currently, the only conversion is adding the h264_mp4toannexb bitstream
filter to H.264 streams in MP4 format. This is necessary in particular if
there are resolution changes.


=back



=head2 flv


Adobe Flash Video Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux FLV files and RTMP network streams.


=over 4


=item B<-flv_metadata> I<bool>

Allocate the streams according to the onMetaData array content.

=back



=head2 libgme


The Game Music Emu library is a collection of video game music file emulators.

See E<lt>B<http://code.google.com/p/game-music-emu/>E<gt> for more information.

Some files have multiple tracks. The demuxer will pick the first track by
default. The B<track_index> option can be used to select a different
track. Track indexes start at 0. The demuxer exports the number of tracks as
I<tracks> meta data entry.

For very large files, the B<max_size> option may have to be adjusted.


=head2 libquvi


Play media from Internet services using the quvi project.

The demuxer accepts a B<format> option to request a specific quality. It
is by default set to I<best>.

See E<lt>B<http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>E<gt> for more information.

FFmpeg needs to be built with C<--enable-libquvi> for this demuxer to be
enabled.


=head2 image2


Image file demuxer.

This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option I<pattern_type>.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.

The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<framerate>

Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

=item B<loop>

If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

=item B<pattern_type>

Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

I<pattern_type> accepts one of the following values.

=over 4


=item B<sequence>

Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.

A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
"%d0I<N>d" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0-padded and I<N> is the total number of 0-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string "%%".

If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between I<start_number> and
I<start_number>+I<start_number_range>-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form F<i%m%g-1.jpg>,
F<i%m%g-2.jpg>, ..., F<i%m%g-10.jpg>, etc.

Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to convert a single image file
F<img.jpeg> you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png



=item B<glob>

Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

The pattern is interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.


=item B<glob_sequence> I<(deprecated, will be removed)>

Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
C<%*?[]{}> that is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.

All glob special characters C<%*?[]{}> must be prefixed
with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".

For example the pattern C<foo-%*.jpeg> will match all the
filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
C<foo-%?%?%?.jpeg> will match all the filenames prefixed with
"foo-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with ".jpeg".

This pattern type is deprecated in favor of I<glob> and
I<sequence>.

=back


Default value is I<glob_sequence>.

=item B<pixel_format>

Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the pixel
format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<start_number>

Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to start
to read from. Default value is 0.

=item B<start_number_range>

Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first image
file in the sequence, starting from I<start_number>. Default value
is 5.

=item B<ts_from_file>

If set to 1, will set frame timestamp to modification time of image file. Note
that monotonity of timestamps is not provided: images go in the same order as
without this option. Default value is 0.
If set to 2, will set frame timestamp to the modification time of the image file in
nanosecond precision.

=item B<video_size>

Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the video
size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> for creating a video from the images in the file
sequence F<img-001.jpeg>, F<img-002.jpeg>, ..., assuming an
input frame rate of 10 frames per second:
	
	ffmpeg -framerate 10 -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' out.mkv



=item *

As above, but start by reading from a file with index 100 in the sequence:
	
	ffmpeg -framerate 10 -start_number 100 -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' out.mkv



=item *

Read images matching the "*.png" glob pattern , that is all the files
terminating with the ".png" suffix:
	
	ffmpeg -framerate 10 -pattern_type glob -i "*.png" out.mkv


=back



=head2 mpegts


MPEG-2 transport stream demuxer.


=over 4



=item B<fix_teletext_pts>

Overrides teletext packet PTS and DTS values with the timestamps calculated
from the PCR of the first program which the teletext stream is part of and is
not discarded. Default value is 1, set this option to 0 if you want your
teletext packet PTS and DTS values untouched.

=back



=head2 rawvideo


Raw video demuxer.

This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them
in order to be able to decode the data correctly.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4



=item B<framerate>

Set input video frame rate. Default value is 25.


=item B<pixel_format>

Set the input video pixel format. Default value is C<yuv420p>.


=item B<video_size>

Set the input video size. This value must be specified explicitly.

=back


For example to read a rawvideo file F<input.raw> with
B<ffplay>, assuming a pixel format of C<rgb24>, a video
size of C<320x240>, and a frame rate of 10 images per second, use
the command:
	
	ffplay -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 320x240 -framerate 10 input.raw



=head2 sbg


SBaGen script demuxer.

This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
E<lt>B<http://uazu.net/sbagen/>E<gt> to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
script looks like that:
	
	-SE
	a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
	b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
	off: -
	NOW      == a
	+0:07:00 == b
	+0:14:00 == a
	+0:21:00 == b
	+0:30:00    off


A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the I<NOW> reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.


=head2 tedcaptions


JSON captions used for E<lt>B<http://www.ted.com/>E<gt>.

TED does not provide links to the captions, but they can be guessed from the
page. The file F<tools/bookmarklets.html> from the FFmpeg source tree
contains a bookmarklet to expose them.

This demuxer accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<start_time>

Set the start time of the TED talk, in milliseconds. The default is 15000
(15s). It is used to sync the captions with the downloadable videos, because
they include a 15s intro.

=back


Example: convert the captions to a format most players understand:
	
	ffmpeg -i http://www.ted.com/talks/subtitles/id/1/lang/en talk1-en.srt



=head1 MUXERS


Muxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow writing
multimedia streams to a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported muxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available muxers using the
configure option C<--list-muxers>.

You can disable all the muxers with the configure option
C<--disable-muxers> and selectively enable / disable single muxers
with the options C<--enable-muxer=I<MUXER>> /
C<--disable-muxer=I<MUXER>>.

The option C<-formats> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled muxers.

A description of some of the currently available muxers follows.



=head2 aiff


Audio Interchange File Format muxer.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<write_id3v2>

Enable ID3v2 tags writing when set to 1. Default is 0 (disabled).


=item B<id3v2_version>

Select ID3v2 version to write. Currently only version 3 and 4 (aka.
ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4) are supported. The default is version 4.


=back




=head2 crc


CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio
and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
CRC=0xI<CRC>, where I<CRC> is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to
8 digits containing the CRC for all the decoded input frames.

See also the B<framecrc> muxer.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the CRC of the input, and store it in the file
F<out.crc>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc out.crc


You can print the CRC to stdout with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc -


You can select the output format of each frame with B<ffmpeg> by
specifying the audio and video codec and format. For example to
compute the CRC of the input audio converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit
and the input video converted to MPEG-2 video, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f crc -




=head2 framecrc


Per-packet CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC for each audio
and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
	
	<stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, 0x<CRC>


I<CRC> is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the
CRC of the packet.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the CRC of the audio and video frames in
F<INPUT>, converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it
in the file F<out.crc>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc out.crc


To print the information to stdout, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc -


With B<ffmpeg>, you can select the output format to which the
audio and video frames are encoded before computing the CRC for each
packet by specifying the audio and video codec. For example, to
compute the CRC of each decoded input audio frame converted to PCM
unsigned 8-bit and of each decoded input video frame converted to
MPEG-2 video, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f framecrc -


See also the B<crc> muxer.



=head2 framemd5


Per-packet MD5 testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash for each audio
and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
hash.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
	
	<stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, <MD5>


I<MD5> is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash
for the packet.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the MD5 of the audio and video frames in
F<INPUT>, converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it
in the file F<out.md5>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 out.md5


To print the information to stdout, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 -


See also the B<md5> muxer.



=head2 gif


Animated GIF muxer.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<loop>

Set the number of times to loop the output. Use C<-1> for no loop, C<0>
for looping indefinitely (default).


=item B<final_delay>

Force the delay (expressed in centiseconds) after the last frame. Each frame
ends with a delay until the next frame. The default is C<-1>, which is a
special value to tell the muxer to re-use the previous delay. In case of a
loop, you might want to customize this value to mark a pause for instance.

=back


For example, to encode a gif looping 10 times, with a 5 seconds delay between
the loops:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -loop 10 -final_delay 500 out.gif


Note 1: if you wish to extract the frames in separate GIF files, you need to
force the B<image2> muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v gif -f image2 "out%d.gif"


Note 2: the GIF format has a very small time base: the delay between two frames
can not be smaller than one centi second.



=head2 hls


Apple HTTP Live Streaming muxer that segments MPEG-TS according to
the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) specification.

It creates a playlist file and numbered segment files. The output
filename specifies the playlist filename; the segment filenames
receive the same basename as the playlist, a sequential number and
a .ts extension.

For example, to convert an input file with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut out.m3u8


See also the B<segment> muxer, which provides a more generic and
flexible implementation of a segmenter, and can be used to perform HLS
segmentation.


=head3 Options


This muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<hls_time> I<seconds>

Set the segment length in seconds. Default value is 2.


=item B<hls_list_size> I<size>

Set the maximum number of playlist entries. If set to 0 the list file
will contain all the segments. Default value is 5.


=item B<hls_wrap> I<wrap>

Set the number after which the segment filename number (the number
specified in each segment file) wraps. If set to 0 the number will be
never wrapped. Default value is 0.

This option is useful to avoid to fill the disk with many segment
files, and limits the maximum number of segment files written to disk
to I<wrap>.


=item B<start_number> I<number>

Start the playlist sequence number from I<number>. Default value is
0.


=item B<hls_base_url> I<baseurl>

Append I<baseurl> to every entry in the playlist.
Useful to generate playlists with absolute paths.

Note that the playlist sequence number must be unique for each segment
and it is not to be confused with the segment filename sequence number
which can be cyclic, for example if the B<wrap> option is
specified.

=back




=head2 ico


ICO file muxer.

Microsoft's icon file format (ICO) has some strict limitations that should be noted:


=over 4


=item *

Size cannot exceed 256 pixels in any dimension


=item *

Only BMP and PNG images can be stored


=item *

If a BMP image is used, it must be one of the following pixel formats:
	
	BMP Bit Depth      FFmpeg Pixel Format
	1bit               pal8
	4bit               pal8
	8bit               pal8
	16bit              rgb555le
	24bit              bgr24
	32bit              bgra



=item *

If a BMP image is used, it must use the BITMAPINFOHEADER DIB header


=item *

If a PNG image is used, it must use the rgba pixel format

=back




=head2 image2


Image file muxer.

The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.

The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form "%0I<N>d" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0-padded to I<N>
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string "%%".

If the pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.
The pattern "img%%-%d.jpg" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form F<img%-1.jpg>, F<img%-2.jpg>, ..., F<img%-10.jpg>,
etc.


=head3 Examples


The following example shows how to use B<ffmpeg> for creating a
sequence of files F<img-001.jpeg>, F<img-002.jpeg>, ...,
taking one image every second from the input video:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 -f image2 'img-%03d.jpeg'


Note that with B<ffmpeg>, if the format is not specified with the
C<-f> option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 'img-%03d.jpeg'


Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to create a single image file
F<img.jpeg> from the input video you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -f image2 -frames:v 1 img.jpeg


The B<strftime> option allows you to expand the filename with
date and time information. Check the documentation of
the C<strftime()> function for the syntax.

For example to generate image files from the C<strftime()>
"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S" pattern, the following B<ffmpeg> command
can be used:
	
	ffmpeg -f v4l2 -r 1 -i /dev/video0 -f image2 -strftime 1 "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.jpg"



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<start_number>

Start the sequence from the specified number. Default value is 1. Must
be a non-negative number.


=item B<update>

If set to 1, the filename will always be interpreted as just a
filename, not a pattern, and the corresponding file will be continuously
overwritten with new images. Default value is 0.


=item B<strftime>

If set to 1, expand the filename with date and time information from
C<strftime()>. Default value is 0.

=back


The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for
each of the YUV420P components. To read or write this image file format,
specify the name of the '.Y' file. The muxer will automatically open the
'.U' and '.V' files as required.

=head3 Options


This muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<reserve_index_space>

By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
-- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow -- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.

If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the available space does not suffice, muxing will fail. A safe size
for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.

Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will
have no effect if it is not.

=head2 md5


MD5 testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash of all the input audio
and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
hash.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
MD5=I<MD5>, where I<MD5> is a hexadecimal number representing
the computed MD5 hash.

For example to compute the MD5 hash of the input converted to raw
audio and video, and store it in the file F<out.md5>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5


You can print the MD5 to stdout with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -


See also the B<framemd5> muxer.


=head2 mov, mp4, ismv


MOV/MP4/ISMV (Smooth Streaming) muxer.

The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a MOV/MP4
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding I<faststart> to the I<movflags>, or
using the B<qt-faststart> tool). A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal MOV/MP4 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal MOV/MP4 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.


=head3 Options


Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
how to cut the file into fragments:


=over 4


=item B<-moov_size> I<bytes>

Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead of placing the
moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is insufficient, muxing will fail.

=item B<-movflags frag_keyframe>

Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.

=item B<-frag_duration> I<duration>

Create fragments that are I<duration> microseconds long.

=item B<-frag_size> I<size>

Create fragments that contain up to I<size> bytes of payload data.

=item B<-movflags frag_custom>

Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
calling C<av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)> to write a fragment with
the packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
applications integrating libavformat, not from B<ffmpeg>.)

=item B<-min_frag_duration> I<duration>

Don't create fragments that are shorter than I<duration> microseconds long.

=back


If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when
one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
C<-min_frag_duration>, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
conditions to apply.

Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
through a few other options:


=over 4


=item B<-movflags empty_moov>

Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal MOV/MP4 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.

Files written with this option set do not work in QuickTime.
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-movflags separate_moof>

Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.

This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-movflags faststart>

Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such
as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.

=item B<-movflags rtphint>

Add RTP hinting tracks to the output file.

=item B<-movflags disable_chpl>

Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.

=back



=head3 Example


Smooth Streaming content can be pushed in real time to a publishing
point on IIS with this muxer. Example:
	
	ffmpeg -re <<normal input/transcoding options>> -movflags isml+frag_keyframe -f ismv http://server/publishingpoint.isml/Streams(Encoder1)



=head2 mp3


The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with an ID3v2 header at the beginning and
optionally an ID3v1 tag at the end. ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4 are supported, the
C<id3v2_version> option controls which one is used. Setting
C<id3v2_version> to 0 will disable the ID3v2 header completely. The legacy
ID3v1 tag is not written by default, but may be enabled with the
C<write_id3v1> option.

The muxer may also write a Xing frame at the beginning, which contains the
number of frames in the file. It is useful for computing duration of VBR files.
The Xing frame is written if the output stream is seekable and if the
C<write_xing> option is set to 1 (the default).

The muxer supports writing ID3v2 attached pictures (APIC frames). The pictures
are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single packet. There
can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a single APIC frame.
The stream metadata tags I<title> and I<comment> map to APIC
I<description> and I<picture type> respectively. See
E<lt>B<http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames>E<gt> for allowed picture types.

Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.

Examples:

Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 out.mp3


To attach a picture to an mp3 file select both the audio and the picture stream
with C<map>:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -i cover.png -c copy -map 0 -map 1
	-metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (Front)" out.mp3


Write a "clean" MP3 without any extra features:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.wav -write_xing 0 -id3v2_version 0 out.mp3



=head2 mpegts


MPEG transport stream muxer.

This muxer implements ISO 13818-1 and part of ETSI EN 300 468.

The recognized metadata settings in mpegts muxer are C<service_provider>
and C<service_name>. If they are not set the default for
C<service_provider> is "FFmpeg" and the default for
C<service_name> is "Service01".


=head3 Options


The muxer options are:


=over 4


=item B<-mpegts_original_network_id> I<number>

Set the original_network_id (default 0x0001). This is unique identifier
of a network in DVB. Its main use is in the unique identification of a
service through the path Original_Network_ID, Transport_Stream_ID.

=item B<-mpegts_transport_stream_id> I<number>

Set the transport_stream_id (default 0x0001). This identifies a
transponder in DVB.

=item B<-mpegts_service_id> I<number>

Set the service_id (default 0x0001) also known as program in DVB.

=item B<-mpegts_pmt_start_pid> I<number>

Set the first PID for PMT (default 0x1000, max 0x1f00).

=item B<-mpegts_start_pid> I<number>

Set the first PID for data packets (default 0x0100, max 0x0f00).

=item B<-mpegts_m2ts_mode> I<number>

Enable m2ts mode if set to 1. Default value is -1 which disables m2ts mode.

=item B<-muxrate> I<number>

Set a constant muxrate (default VBR).

=item B<-pcr_period> I<numer>

Override the default PCR retransmission time (default 20ms), ignored
if variable muxrate is selected.

=item B<-pes_payload_size> I<number>

Set minimum PES packet payload in bytes.

=item B<-mpegts_flags> I<flags>

Set flags (see below).

=item B<-mpegts_copyts> I<number>

Preserve original timestamps, if value is set to 1. Default value is -1, which
results in shifting timestamps so that they start from 0.

=item B<-tables_version> I<number>

Set PAT, PMT and SDT version (default 0, valid values are from 0 to 31, inclusively).
This option allows updating stream structure so that standard consumer may
detect the change. To do so, reopen output AVFormatContext (in case of API
usage) or restart ffmpeg instance, cyclically changing tables_version value:
	
	ffmpeg -i source1.ts -codec copy -f mpegts -tables_version 0 udp://1.1.1.1:1111
	ffmpeg -i source2.ts -codec copy -f mpegts -tables_version 1 udp://1.1.1.1:1111
	...
	ffmpeg -i source3.ts -codec copy -f mpegts -tables_version 31 udp://1.1.1.1:1111
	ffmpeg -i source1.ts -codec copy -f mpegts -tables_version 0 udp://1.1.1.1:1111
	ffmpeg -i source2.ts -codec copy -f mpegts -tables_version 1 udp://1.1.1.1:1111
	...


=back


Option mpegts_flags may take a set of such flags:


=over 4


=item B<resend_headers>

Reemit PAT/PMT before writing the next packet.

=item B<latm>

Use LATM packetization for AAC.

=back



=head3 Example


	
	ffmpeg -i file.mpg -c copy \
	     -mpegts_original_network_id 0x1122 \
	     -mpegts_transport_stream_id 0x3344 \
	     -mpegts_service_id 0x5566 \
	     -mpegts_pmt_start_pid 0x1500 \
	     -mpegts_start_pid 0x150 \
	     -metadata service_provider="Some provider" \
	     -metadata service_name="Some Channel" \
	     -y out.ts



=head2 null


Null muxer.

This muxer does not generate any output file, it is mainly useful for
testing or benchmarking purposes.

For example to benchmark decoding with B<ffmpeg> you can use the
command:
	
	ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null out.null


Note that the above command does not read or write the F<out.null>
file, but specifying the output file is required by the B<ffmpeg>
syntax.

Alternatively you can write the command as:
	
	ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null -



=head2 nut



=over 4


=item B<-syncpoints> I<flags>

Change the syncpoint usage in nut:

=over 4


=item I<default> B<use the normal low-overhead seeking aids.>


=item I<none> B<do not use the syncpoints at all, reducing the overhead but making the stream non-seekable;>

    Use of this option is not recommended, as the resulting files are very damage
    sensitive and seeking is not possible. Also in general the overhead from
    syncpoints is negligible. Note, -C<write_index> 0 can be used to disable
    all growing data tables, allowing to mux endless streams with limited memory
    and wihout these disadvantages.

=item I<timestamped> B<extend the syncpoint with a wallclock field.>


=back

The I<none> and I<timestamped> flags are experimental.

=item B<-write_index> I<bool>

Write index at the end, the default is to write an index.

=back


	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f_strict experimental -syncpoints none - | processor



=head2 ogg


Ogg container muxer.


=over 4


=item B<-page_duration> I<duration>

Preferred page duration, in microseconds. The muxer will attempt to create
pages that are approximately I<duration> microseconds long. This allows the
user to compromise between seek granularity and container overhead. The default
is 1 second. A value of 0 will fill all segments, making pages as large as
possible. A value of 1 will effectively use 1 packet-per-page in most
situations, giving a small seek granularity at the cost of additional container
overhead.

=back




=head2 segment, stream_segment, ssegment


Basic stream segmenter.

This muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of nearly
fixed duration. Output filename pattern can be set in a fashion similar to
B<image2>.

C<stream_segment> is a variant of the muxer used to write to
streaming output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers,
and is recommended for outputting e.g. to MPEG transport stream segments.
C<ssegment> is a shorter alias for C<stream_segment>.

Every segment starts with a keyframe of the selected reference stream,
which is set through the B<reference_stream> option.

Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
time.

The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.

Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
the option I<segment_list>. The list type is specified by the
I<segment_list_type> option. The entry filenames in the segment
list are set by default to the basename of the corresponding segment
files.

See also the B<hls> muxer, which provides a more specific
implementation for HLS segmentation.


=head3 Options


The segment muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<reference_stream> I<specifier>

Set the reference stream, as specified by the string I<specifier>.
If I<specifier> is set to C<auto>, the reference is chosen
automatically. Otherwise it must be a stream specifier (see the ``Stream
specifiers'' chapter in the ffmpeg manual) which specifies the
reference stream. The default value is C<auto>.


=item B<segment_format> I<format>

Override the inner container format, by default it is guessed by the filename
extension.


=item B<segment_list> I<name>

Generate also a listfile named I<name>. If not specified no
listfile is generated.


=item B<segment_list_flags> I<flags>

Set flags affecting the segment list generation.

It currently supports the following flags:

=over 4


=item B<cache>

Allow caching (only affects M3U8 list files).


=item B<live>

Allow live-friendly file generation.

=back



=item B<segment_list_type> I<type>

Select the listing format.

=over 4


=item I<flat> B<use a simple flat list of entries.>


=item I<hls> B<use a m3u8-like structure.>


=back



=item B<segment_list_size> I<size>

Update the list file so that it contains at most I<size>
segments. If 0 the list file will contain all the segments. Default
value is 0.


=item B<segment_list_entry_prefix> I<prefix>

Prepend I<prefix> to each entry. Useful to generate absolute paths.
By default no prefix is applied.

The following values are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<flat>

Generate a flat list for the created segments, one segment per line.


=item B<csv, ext>

Generate a list for the created segments, one segment per line,
each line matching the format (comma-separated values):
	
	<segment_filename>,<segment_start_time>,<segment_end_time>


I<segment_filename> is the name of the output file generated by the
muxer according to the provided pattern. CSV escaping (according to
RFC4180) is applied if required.

I<segment_start_time> and I<segment_end_time> specify
the segment start and end time expressed in seconds.

A list file with the suffix C<".csv"> or C<".ext"> will
auto-select this format.

B<ext> is deprecated in favor or B<csv>.


=item B<ffconcat>

Generate an ffconcat file for the created segments. The resulting file
can be read using the FFmpeg B<concat> demuxer.

A list file with the suffix C<".ffcat"> or C<".ffconcat"> will
auto-select this format.


=item B<m3u8>

Generate an extended M3U8 file, version 3, compliant with
E<lt>B<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming>E<gt>.

A list file with the suffix C<".m3u8"> will auto-select this format.

=back


If not specified the type is guessed from the list file name suffix.


=item B<segment_time> I<time>

Set segment duration to I<time>, the value must be a duration
specification. Default value is "2". See also the
B<segment_times> option.

Note that splitting may not be accurate, unless you force the
reference stream key-frames at the given time. See the introductory
notice and the examples below.


=item B<segment_atclocktime> I<1|0>

If set to "1" split at regular clock time intervals starting from 00:00
o'clock. The I<time> value specified in B<segment_time> is
used for setting the length of the splitting interval.

For example with B<segment_time> set to "900" this makes it possible
to create files at 12:00 o'clock, 12:15, 12:30, etc.

Default value is "0".


=item B<segment_time_delta> I<delta>

Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
segment, expressed as a duration specification. Default value is "0".

When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
PTS satisfies the relation:
	
	PTS >= start_time - time_delta


This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
split at GOP boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before the
specified split time.

In particular may be used in combination with the F<ffmpeg> option
I<force_key_frames>. The key frame times specified by
I<force_key_frames> may not be set accurately because of rounding
issues, with the consequence that a key frame time may result set just
before the specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
1/(2*I<frame_rate>) should address the worst case mismatch between
the specified time and the time set by I<force_key_frames>.


=item B<segment_times> I<times>

Specify a list of split points. I<times> contains a list of comma
separated duration specifications, in increasing order. See also
the B<segment_time> option.


=item B<segment_frames> I<frames>

Specify a list of split video frame numbers. I<frames> contains a
list of comma separated integer numbers, in increasing order.

This option specifies to start a new segment whenever a reference
stream key frame is found and the sequential number (starting from 0)
of the frame is greater or equal to the next value in the list.


=item B<segment_wrap> I<limit>

Wrap around segment index once it reaches I<limit>.


=item B<segment_start_number> I<number>

Set the sequence number of the first segment. Defaults to C<0>.


=item B<reset_timestamps> I<1|0>

Reset timestamps at the begin of each segment, so that each segment
will start with near-zero timestamps. It is meant to ease the playback
of the generated segments. May not work with some combinations of
muxers/codecs. It is set to C<0> by default.


=item B<initial_offset> I<offset>

Specify timestamp offset to apply to the output packet timestamps. The
argument must be a time duration specification, and defaults to 0.

Specify the minimum fragment duration (in microseconds). Default 5000000.


=item B<remove_at_exit>

Specify whether to remove all fragments when finished. Default 0 (do not remove).


=back



=head2 tee


The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several files or any
other kind of muxer. It can be used, for example, to both stream a video to
the network and save it to disk at the same time.

It is different from specifying several outputs to the B<ffmpeg>
command-line tool because the audio and video data will be encoded only once
with the tee muxer; encoding can be a very expensive process. It is not
useful when using the libavformat API directly because it is then possible
to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.

The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, it must be
escaped (see B<the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>).

Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
I<key>=I<value> pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.

The following special options are also recognized:

=over 4


=item B<f>

Specify the format name. Useful if it cannot be guessed from the
output name suffix.


=item B<bsfs[/>I<spec>B<]>

Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.

It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
C</>. I<spec> must be a stream specifier (see B<Format
stream specifiers>).  If the stream specifier is not specified, the
bitstream filters will be applied to all streams in the output.

Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by ",".


=item B<select>

Select the streams that should be mapped to the slave output,
specified by a stream specifier. If not specified, this defaults to
all the input streams.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Encode something and both archive it in a WebM file and stream it
as MPEG-TS over UDP (the streams need to be explicitly mapped):
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -c:v libx264 -c:a mp2 -f tee -map 0:v -map 0:a
	  "archive-20121107.mkv|[f=mpegts]udp://10.0.1.255:1234/"



=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> to encode the input, and send the output
to three different destinations. The C<dump_extra> bitstream
filter is used to add extradata information to all the output video
keyframes packets, as requested by the MPEG-TS format. The select
option is applied to F<out.aac> in order to make it contain only
audio packets.
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -map 0 -flags +global_header -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental
	       -f tee "[bsfs/v=dump_extra]out.ts|[movflags=+faststart]out.mp4|[select=a]out.aac"



=item *

As below, but select only stream C<a:1> for the audio output. Note
that a second level escaping must be performed, as ":" is a special
character used to separate options.
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -map 0 -flags +global_header -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental
	       -f tee "[bsfs/v=dump_extra]out.ts|[movflags=+faststart]out.mp4|[select=\'a:1\']out.aac"

=head1 METADATA


FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF-8-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.

The file format is as follows:

=over 4



=item 1.

A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.


=item 2.

The header is a ';FFMETADATA' string, followed by a version number (now 1).


=item 3.

Metadata tags are of the form 'key=value'


=item 4.

Immediately after header follows global metadata


=item 5.

After global metadata there may be sections with per-stream/per-chapter
metadata.


=item 6.

A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. STREAM or CHAPTER) in
brackets ('[', ']') and ends with next section or end of file.


=item 7.

At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form 'TIMEBASE=num/den', where num and
den are integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in milliseconds.
Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
'START=num', 'END=num', where num is a positive integer.


=item 8.

Empty lines and lines starting with ';' or '#' are ignored.


=item 9.

Metadata keys or values containing special characters ('=', ';', '#', '\' and a
newline) must be escaped with a backslash '\'.


=item 10.

Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. foo = bar) is considered to be a part of
the tag (in the example above key is 'foo ', value is ' bar').

=back


A ffmetadata file might look like this:
	
	;FFMETADATA1
	title=bike\\shed
	;this is a comment
	artist=FFmpeg troll team
	
	[CHAPTER]
	TIMEBASE=1/1000
	START=0
	#chapter ends at 0:01:00
	END=60000
	title=chapter \#1
	[STREAM]
	title=multi\
	line


By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to extract
metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and then transcode
the file into an output file with the edited ffmetadata file.

Extracting an ffmetadata file with F<ffmpeg> goes as follows:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE


Reinserting edited metadata information from the FFMETADATAFILE file can
be done as:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -i FFMETADATAFILE -map_metadata 1 -codec copy OUTPUT



=head1 PROTOCOLS


Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access to
resources that require specific protocols.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-protocols".

You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
"--disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "--enable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
"--disable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>".

The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.

A description of the currently available protocols follows.


=head2 bluray


Read BluRay playlist.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<angle>

BluRay angle


=item B<chapter>

Start chapter (1...N)


=item B<playlist>

Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)


=back


Examples:

Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:
	
	bluray:/mnt/bluray


Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from chapter 2:
	
	-playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray



=head2 cache


Caching wrapper for input stream.

Cache the input stream to temporary file. It brings seeking capability to live streams.

	
	cache:<URL>



=head2 concat


Physical concatenation protocol.

Allow to read and seek from many resource in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.

A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
	
	concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>


where I<URL1>, I<URL2>, ..., I<URLN> are the urls of the
resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol.

For example to read a sequence of files F<split1.mpeg>,
F<split2.mpeg>, F<split3.mpeg> with B<ffplay> use the
command:
	
	ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg


Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for
many shells.


=head2 crypto


AES-encrypted stream reading protocol.

The accepted options are:

=over 4


=item B<key>

Set the AES decryption key binary block from given hexadecimal representation.


=item B<iv>

Set the AES decryption initialization vector binary block from given hexadecimal representation.

=back


Accepted URL formats:
	
	crypto:<URL>
	crypto+<URL>



=head2 data


Data in-line in the URI. See E<lt>B<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme>E<gt>.

For example, to convert a GIF file given inline with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhCAAIAMIEAAAAAAAA//8AAP//AP///////////////ywAAAAACAAIAAADF0gEDLojDgdGiJdJqUX02iB4E8Q9jUMkADs=" smiley.png



=head2 file


File access protocol.

Allow to read from or write to a file.

A file URL can have the form:
	
	file:<filename>


where I<filename> is the path of the file to read.

An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a
file URL. Depending on the build, an URL that looks like a Windows
path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be
a file URL (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).

For example to read from a file F<input.mpeg> with B<ffmpeg>
use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<truncate>

Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents
truncating. Default value is 1.


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.

=back



=head2 ftp


FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Allow to read from or write to remote resources using FTP protocol.

Following syntax is required.
	
	ftp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]/path/to/remote/resource.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.


=item B<ftp-anonymous-password>

Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e-mail address
should be used.


=item B<ftp-write-seekable>

Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set to 1 the
resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not
to be seekable. Default value is 0.

=back


NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do
it, unless special care is taken (tests, customized server configuration
etc.). Different FTP servers behave in different way during seek
operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.


=head2 gopher


Gopher protocol.


=head2 hls


Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+I<proto>" after the hls URI scheme name, where I<proto>
is either "file" or "http".

	
	hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
	hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8


Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work
just as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.
To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the
m3u8 files.


=head2 http


HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<seekable>

Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the resource is
supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable,
if set to -1 it will try to autodetect if it is seekable. Default
value is -1.


=item B<chunked_post>

If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts, default is 1.


=item B<content_type>

Set a specific content type for the POST messages.


=item B<headers>

Set custom HTTP headers, can override built in default headers. The
value must be a string encoding the headers.


=item B<multiple_requests>

Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.


=item B<post_data>

Set custom HTTP post data.


=item B<user-agent>


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the protocol will use a
string describing the libavformat build. ("Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>")


=item B<timeout>

Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.


=item B<mime_type>

Export the MIME type.


=item B<icy>

If set to 1 request ICY (SHOUTcast) metadata from the server. If the server
supports this, the metadata has to be retrieved by the application by reading
the B<icy_metadata_headers> and B<icy_metadata_packet> options.
The default is 1.


=item B<icy_metadata_headers>

If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the ICY-specific HTTP reply
headers, separated by newline characters.


=item B<icy_metadata_packet>

If the server supports ICY metadata, and B<icy> was set to 1, this
contains the last non-empty metadata packet sent by the server. It should be
polled in regular intervals by applications interested in mid-stream metadata
updates.


=item B<cookies>

Set the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format of each cookie is the
same as the value of a Set-Cookie HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be
delimited by a newline character.


=item B<offset>

Set initial byte offset.


=item B<end_offset>

Try to limit the request to bytes preceding this offset.

=back



=head3 HTTP Cookies


Some HTTP requests will be denied unless cookie values are passed in with the
request. The B<cookies> option allows these cookies to be specified. At
the very least, each cookie must specify a value along with a path and domain.
HTTP requests that match both the domain and path will automatically include the
cookie value in the HTTP Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited
by a newline.

The required syntax to play a stream specifying a cookie is:
	
	ffplay -cookies "nlqptid=nltid=tsn; path=/; domain=somedomain.com;" http://somedomain.com/somestream.m3u8



=head2 Icecast


Icecast protocol (stream to Icecast servers)

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<ice_genre>

Set the stream genre.


=item B<ice_name>

Set the stream name.


=item B<ice_description>

Set the stream description.


=item B<ice_url>

Set the stream website URL.


=item B<ice_public>

Set if the stream should be public.
The default is 0 (not public).


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified a string of the form
"Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>" will be used.


=item B<password>

Set the Icecast mountpoint password.


=item B<content_type>

Set the stream content type. This must be set if it is different from
audio/mpeg.


=item B<legacy_icecast>

This enables support for Icecast versions E<lt> 2.4.0, that do not support the
HTTP PUT method but the SOURCE method.


=back


	
	icecast://[<username>[:<password>]@]<server>:<port>/<mountpoint>



=head2 mmst


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.


=head2 mmsh


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

The required syntax is:
	
	mmsh://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>]



=head2 md5


MD5 output protocol.

Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can
be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

Some examples follow.
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:


Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.


=head2 pipe


UNIX pipe access protocol.

Allow to read and write from UNIX pipes.

The accepted syntax is:
	
	pipe:[<number>]


I<number> is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the
pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If I<number>
is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used
for writing, stdin for reading.

For example to read from stdin with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
	# ...this is the same as...
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:


For writing to stdout with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
	# ...this is the same as...
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.

=back


Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.


=head2 rtmp


Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for streaming multimedia
content across a TCP/IP network.

The required syntax is:
	
	rtmp://[<username>:<password>@]<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<instance>][/<playpath>]

=item B<app>

It is the name of the application to access. It usually corresponds to
the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
(e.g. F</ondemand/>, F</flash/live/>, etc.). You can override
the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_app> option, too.


=item B<playpath>

It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to the
application specified in I<app>, may be prefixed by "mp4:". You
can override the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_playpath>

Extra arbitrary AMF connection parameters, parsed from a string,
e.g. like C<B:1 S:authMe O:1 NN:code:1.23 NS:flag:ok O:0>.
Each value is prefixed by a single character denoting the type,
B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null,
followed by a colon. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for
FALSE or TRUE, respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or
1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may
be named, by prefixing the type with 'N' and specifying the name before
the value (i.e. C<NB:myFlag:1>). This option may be used multiple
times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences.


=item B<rtmp_flashver>

Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default

is 10.


=item B<rtmp_live>

Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
live streams is possible. The default value is C<any>, which means the
subscriber first tries to play the live stream specified in the
playpath. If a live stream of that name is not found, it plays the
recorded stream. The other possible values are C<live> and
C<recorded>.


=item B<rtmp_pageurl>

URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
value will be sent.

=head2 librtmp rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte


Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through
librtmp.

Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
"--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
protocol.

This protocol provides most client functions and a few server
functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT),
encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled
variants of these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

The required syntax is:
	
	<rtmp_proto>://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>] <options>


where I<rtmp_proto> is one of the strings "rtmp", "rtmpt", "rtmpe",
"rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each RTMP variant, and
I<server>, I<port>, I<app> and I<playpath> have the same
meaning as specified for the RTMP native protocol.
I<options> contains a list of space-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream


To play the same stream using B<ffplay>:
	
	ffplay "rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1"



=head2 rtp


Real-time Transport Protocol.

The required syntax for an RTP URL is:
rtp://I<hostname>[:I<port>][?I<option>=I<val>...]

I<port> specifies the RTP port to use.

Send packets to the source address of the latest received packet (if
set to 1) or to a default remote address (if set to 0).


=item B<localport=>I<n>

Set the local RTP port to I<n>.

This is a deprecated option. Instead, B<localrtpport> should be
used.


=back


Important notes:


=over 4



=item 1.

If B<rtcpport> is not set the RTCP port will be set to the RTP
port value plus 1.


=item 2.

If B<localrtpport> (the local RTP port) is not set any available
port will be used for the local RTP and RTCP ports.


=item 3.

If B<localrtcpport> (the local RTCP port) is not set it will be
set to the the local RTP port value plus 1.

=back



=head2 rtsp


Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a demuxer
and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred
over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with
data transferred over RDT).

The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's
E<lt>B<https://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server>E<gt>).

The required syntax for a RTSP url is:
	
	rtsp://<hostname>[:<port>]/<path>


Options can be set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line, or set in code via C<AVOption>s or in
C<avformat_open_input>.

The following options are supported.


=over 4


=item B<initial_pause>

Do not start playing the stream immediately if set to 1. Default value
is 0.


=item B<rtsp_transport>

Set RTSP transport protocols.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<udp>

Use UDP as lower transport protocol.


=item B<tcp>

Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
transport protocol.


=item B<udp_multicast>

Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.


=item B<http>

Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
passing proxies.

=back


Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they are
tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is tried).
For the muxer, only the B<tcp> and B<udp> options are supported.


=item B<rtsp_flags>

Set RTSP flags.

The following values are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<filter_src>

Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

=item B<prefer_tcp>

Try TCP for RTP transport first, if TCP is available as RTSP RTP transport.

=back


Default value is B<none>.


=item B<allowed_media_types>

Set media types to accept from the server.

The following flags are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<video>


=item B<audio>


=item B<data>


=back


By default it accepts all media types.


=item B<min_port>

Set minimum local UDP port. Default value is 5000.


=item B<max_port>

Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.


=item B<timeout>

Set maximum timeout (in seconds) to wait for incoming connections.

A value of -1 means infinite (default). This option implies the
B<rtsp_flags> set to B<listen>.


=item B<reorder_queue_size>

Set number of packets to buffer for handling of reordered packets.


=item B<stimeout>

Set socket TCP I/O timeout in microseconds.


=item B<user-agent>

Override User-Agent header. If not specified, it defaults to the
libavformat identifier string.

=back


When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received packets
(since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost totally). This
can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to zero (via
the C<max_delay> field of AVFormatContext).

When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with B<ffplay>, the
streams to display can be chosen with C<-vst> I<n> and
C<-ast> I<n> for video and audio respectively, and can be switched
on the fly by pressing C<v> and C<a>.


=head3 Examples


The following examples all make use of the B<ffplay> and
B<ffmpeg> tools.


=over 4


=item *

	ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp <output>


=back



=head2 sap


Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.
It is used for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the
streams regularly on a separate port.


=head3 Muxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:
	
	sap://<destination>[:<port>][?<options>]


The RTP packets are sent to I<destination> on port I<port>,
or to port 5004 if no port is specified.
I<options> is a C<&>-separated list. The following options
are supported:


=over 4



=item B<announce_addr=>I<address>

Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.
If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used SAP
announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
ff0e::2:7ffe if I<destination> is an IPv6 address.


=item B<announce_port=>I<port>

Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to
9875 if not specified.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets,
defaults to 255.


=item B<same_port=>I<0|1>

If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the
default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each stream on a
port 2 numbers higher than the previous.
VLC/Live555 requires this to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.
The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving requires all streams to be sent
on unique ports.

=back


Example command lines follow.

To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1


Similarly, for watching in B<ffplay>:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255


And for watching in B<ffplay>, over IPv6:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]



=head3 Demuxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:
	
	sap://[<address>][:<port>]


I<address> is the multicast address to listen for announcements on,
if omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. I<port>
is the port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular stream.

Example command lines follow.

To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://


To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]



=head2 sctp

The accepted URL syntax is:
	
	sctp://<host>:<port>[?<options>]


The protocol accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<listen>

If set to any value, listen for an incoming connection. Outgoing connection is done by default.


=item B<max_streams>

Set the maximum number of streams. By default no limit is set.

The underlying stream must be seekable.

Accepted options:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Start offset of the extracted segment, in bytes.

=item B<end>

End offset of the extracted segment, in bytes.

=back


Examples:

=head2 tcp


Transmission Control Protocol.

The required syntax for a TCP url is:
	
	tcp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<listen=>I<1|0>

Listen for an incoming connection. Default value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<listen_timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set listen timeout, expressed in microseconds.

=back


The following example shows how to setup a listening TCP connection
with B<ffmpeg>, which is then accessed with B<ffplay>:
	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tcp://<hostname>:<port>?listen
	ffplay tcp://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 tls


Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:
	
	tls://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4



=item B<ca_file, cafile=>I<filename>

A file containing certificate authority (CA) root certificates to treat
as trusted. If the linked TLS library contains a default this might not
need to be specified for verification to work, but not all libraries and
setups have defaults built in.
The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.


=item B<tls_verify=>I<1|0>

If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the CA
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With GnuTLS,
the host name is validated as well.)

This is disabled by default since it requires a CA database to be
provided by the caller in many cases.


=item B<cert_file, cert=>I<filename>

A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake with the peer.
(When operating as server, in listen mode, this is more often required
by the peer, while client certificates only are mandated in certain
setups.)


=item B<key_file, key=>I<filename>

A file containing the private key for the certificate.


=item B<listen=>I<1|0>

If enabled, listen for connections on the provided port, and assume
the server role in the handshake instead of the client role.


=back


Example command lines:

To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tls://<hostname>:<port>?listen&cert=<server.crt>&key=<server.key>


To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using B<ffplay>:

	
	ffplay tls://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 udp


User Datagram Protocol.

The required syntax for an UDP URL is:
	
	udp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form I<key>=I<val>.

In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows one to reduce loss of data due to
UDP socket buffer overruns. The I<fifo_size> and
I<overrun_nonfatal> options are related to this buffer.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<buffer_size=>I<size>

Set the UDP maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is used to set either
the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 64KB.  See also I<fifo_size>.


=item B<localport=>I<port>

Override the local UDP port to bind with.


=item B<localaddr=>I<addr>

Choose the local IP address. This is useful e.g. if sending multicast
and the host has multiple interfaces, where the user can choose
which interface to send on by specifying the IP address of that interface.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<size>

Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.


=item B<reuse=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Set the time to live value (for multicast only).


=item B<connect=>I<1|0>

Initialize the UDP socket with C<connect()>. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
unreachable" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.


=item B<sources=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Only receive packets sent to the multicast group from one of the
specified sender IP addresses.


=item B<block=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Ignore packets sent to the multicast group from the specified
sender IP addresses.


=item B<fifo_size=>I<units>

Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.


=item B<overrun_nonfatal=>I<1|0>

Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<broadcast=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow UDP broadcasting.

Note that broadcasting may not work properly on networks having
a broadcast storm protection.

Unix local socket

The required syntax for a Unix socket URL is:

	
	unix://<filepath>


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Timeout in ms.

=item B<listen>

Create the Unix socket in listening mode.

=back



=head1 DEVICE OPTIONS


The libavdevice library provides the same interface as
libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered like a demuxer, and
an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device
options are the same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats
manual).

In addition each input or output device may support so-called private
options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.



=head1 INPUT DEVICES


Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access
the data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-indevs".

You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
"--disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input device using the
option "--enable-indev=I<INDEV>", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-indev=I<INDEV>".

The option "-devices" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported input devices.

A description of the currently available input devices follows.


=head2 alsa


ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
installed on your system.

This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

An ALSA identifier has the syntax:
	
	hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]


where the I<DEV> and I<SUBDEV> components are optional.

The three arguments (in order: I<CARD>,I<DEV>,I<SUBDEV>)
specify card number or identifier, device number and subdevice number
(-1 means any).

To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
files F</proc/asound/cards> and F</proc/asound/devices>.

For example to capture with B<ffmpeg> from an ALSA device with
card id 0, you may run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav


For more information see:
E<lt>B<http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html>E<gt>


=head2 avfoundation


AVFoundation input device.

AVFoundation is the currently recommended framework by Apple for streamgrabbing on OSX E<gt>= 10.7 as well as on iOS.
The older QTKit framework has been marked deprecated since OSX version 10.7.

The filename passed as input is parsed to contain either a device name or index.
The device index can also be given by using -video_device_index.
A given device index will override any given device name.
If the desired device consists of numbers only, use -video_device_index to identify it.
The default device will be chosen if an empty string  or the device name "default" is given.
The available devices can be enumerated by using -list_devices.
The pixel format can be set using -pixel_format.
Available formats:
 monob, rgb555be, rgb555le, rgb565be, rgb565le, rgb24, bgr24, 0rgb, bgr0, 0bgr, rgb0,
 bgr48be, uyvy422, yuva444p, yuva444p16le, yuv444p, yuv422p16, yuv422p10, yuv444p10,
 yuv420p, nv12, yuyv422, gray

=head2 bktr


BSD video input device.


=head2 dshow


Windows DirectShow input device.

DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64 project.
Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be
opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between them.

The input name should be in the format:

	
	<TYPE>=<NAME>[:<TYPE>=<NAME>]


where I<TYPE> can be either I<audio> or I<video>,
and I<NAME> is the device's name.


=head3 Options


If no options are specified, the device's defaults are used.
If the device does not support the requested options, it will
fail to open.

Set video device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
defaults to 0).


=item B<audio_device_number>

Set audio device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
defaults to 0).


=item B<pixel_format>

Select pixel format to be used by DirectShow. This may only be set when
the video codec is not set or set to rawvideo.


=item B<audio_buffer_size>

Set audio device buffer size in milliseconds (which can directly
impact latency, depending on the device).
Defaults to using the audio device's
default buffer size (typically some multiple of 500ms).
Setting this value too low can degrade performance.

=head2 dv1394


Linux DV 1394 input device.


=head2 fbdev


Linux framebuffer input device.

The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction
layer to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the
console. It is accessed through a file device node, usually
F</dev/fb0>.

For more detailed information read the file
Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source tree.

To record from the framebuffer device F</dev/fb0> with
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f fbdev -r 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi


You can take a single screenshot image with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f fbdev -frames:v 1 -r 1 -i /dev/fb0 screenshot.jpeg


See also E<lt>B<http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/>E<gt>, and fbset(1).


=head2 gdigrab


Win32 GDI-based screen capture device.

This device allows you to capture a region of the display on Windows.

There are two options for the input filename:
	
	desktop

or
	
	title=<window_title>


The first option will capture the entire desktop, or a fixed region of the
desktop. The second option will instead capture the contents of a single
window, regardless of its position on the screen.

For example, to grab the entire desktop using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i desktop out.mpg


Grab a 640x480 region at position C<10,20>:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -video_size vga -i desktop out.mpg


Grab the contents of the window named "Calculator"
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -framerate 6 -i title=Calculator out.mpg



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<draw_mouse>

Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. Use the value C<0> to
not draw the pointer. Default value is C<1>.


=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a frame rate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

Note that I<show_region> is incompatible with grabbing the contents
of a single window.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f gdigrab -show_region 1 -framerate 6 -video_size cif -offset_x 10 -offset_y 20 -i desktop out.mpg



=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. The default is to capture the full screen if F<desktop> is selected, or the full window size if F<title=I<window_title>> is selected.


=item B<offset_x>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the left edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned to the left of your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_x> value to move the region to that monitor.


=item B<offset_y>

When capturing a region with I<video_size>, set the distance from the top edge of the screen or desktop.

Note that the offset calculation is from the top left corner of the primary monitor on Windows. If you have a monitor positioned above your primary monitor, you will need to use a negative I<offset_y> value to move the region to that monitor.


=back



=head2 iec61883


FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
C<--enable-libiec61883> to compile with the device enabled.

The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux
Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or "auto"
to choose the first port connected.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<dvtype>

Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto
detection does not work, or if usage of a different device type
should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV (or vice versa) will
not work and result in undefined behavior.
The values B<auto>, B<dv> and B<hdv> are supported.


=item B<dvbuffer>

Set maxiumum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV, this
is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV does
not have a fixed frame size.


=item B<dvguid>

Select the capture device by specifying it's GUID. Capturing will only
be performed from the specified device and fails if no device with the
given GUID is found. This is useful to select the input if multiple
devices are connected at the same time.
Look at /sys/bus/firewire/devices to find out the GUIDs.

=head2 jack


JACK input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
installed on your system.

A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
each audio channel, with name I<client_name>:input_I<N>, where
I<client_name> is the name provided by the application, and I<N>
is a number which identifies the channel.
Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input
device.

Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the B<jack_connect>
and B<jack_disconnect> programs, or do it through a graphical interface,
for example with B<qjackctl>.

To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
B<jack_lsp>.

Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
with B<ffmpeg>.
	
	# Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
	$ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav
	
	# Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
	$ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000
	
	# List the current JACK clients.
	$ jack_lsp -c
	system:capture_1
	system:capture_2
	system:playback_1
	system:playback_2
	ffmpeg:input_1
	metro:120_bpm
	
	# Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.
	$ jack_connect metro:120_bpm ffmpeg:input_1

=head2 lavfi


Libavfilter input virtual device.

This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
filtergraph.

For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
option B<graph>.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<graph>

Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be
labelled by a unique string of the form "outI<N>", where I<N> is a
number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
generated by the device.
The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the "out0"
label, but all the others need to be specified explicitly.

If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
device.


=item B<graph_file>

Set the filename of the filtergraph to be read and sent to the other
filters. Syntax of the filtergraph is the same as the one specified by
the option I<graph>.

=head2 libcdio


Audio-CD input device based on cdio.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libcdio
installed on your system. Requires the configure option
C<--enable-libcdio>.

This device allows playing and grabbing from an Audio-CD.

For example to copy with B<ffmpeg> the entire Audio-CD in /dev/sr0,
you may run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f libcdio -i /dev/sr0 cd.wav



=head2 libdc1394


IIDC1394 input device, based on libdc1394 and libraw1394.

Requires the configure option C<--enable-libdc1394>.


=head2 openal


The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a
working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL
headers and libraries installed on your system, and need to configure
FFmpeg with C<--enable-openal>.

OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of your OpenAL
implementation, or as an additional download (an SDK). Depending on your
installation you may need to specify additional flags via the

=head2 video4linux2, v4l2


Video4Linux2 input video device.

"v4l2" can be used as alias for "video4linux2".

If FFmpeg is built with v4l-utils support (by using the
C<--enable-libv4l2> configure option), it is possible to use it with the
C<-use_libv4l2> input device option.

The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device
(e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the
kind F</dev/videoI<N>>, where I<N> is a number associated to
the device.

Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
I<width>xI<height> sizes and frame rates. You can check which are
supported using B<-list_formats all> for Video4Linux2 devices.
Some devices, like TV cards, support one or more standards. It is possible
to list all the supported standards using B<-list_standards all>.

The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel
version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time
clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at
boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The
B<-timestamps abs> or B<-ts abs> option can be used to force
conversion into the real time clock.

Some usage examples of the video4linux2 device with B<ffmpeg>
and B<ffplay>:

=over 4

0 to 9. You may use "list" as filename to print a list of drivers. Any
other filename will be interpreted as device number 0.


=head2 x11grab


X11 video input device.

Depends on X11, Xext, and Xfixes. Requires the configure option
C<--enable-x11grab>.

This device allows one to capture a region of an X11 display.

The filename passed as input has the syntax:
	
	[<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]


I<hostname>:I<display_number>.I<screen_number> specifies the
X11 display name of the screen to grab from. I<hostname> can be
omitted, and defaults to "localhost". The environment variable
B<DISPLAY> contains the default display name.

I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> specify the offsets of the grabbed
area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They
default to 0.

Check the X11 documentation (e.g. man X) for more detailed information.

=item B<buffer_size>


=item B<buffer_duration>

Control the size and duration of the PulseAudio buffer. A small buffer
gives more control, but requires more frequent updates.

B<buffer_size> specifies size in bytes while
B<buffer_duration> specifies duration in milliseconds.

When both options are provided then the highest value is used
(duration is recalculated to bytes using stream parameters). If they
are set to 0 (which is default), the device will use the default
PulseAudio duration value. By default PulseAudio set buffer duration
to around 2 seconds.


=item B<prebuf>

Specify pre-buffering size in bytes. The server does not start with

This can be used to prevent clipping vs. preventing volumn reduction
A value of 1.0 prevents cliping.


=item B<flags, swr_flags>

Set flags used by the converter. Default value is 0.

It supports the following individual flags:

=over 4


=item B<res>

force resampling, this flag forces resampling to be used even when the
input and output sample rates match.

=back



=item B<dither_scale>

Set the dither scale. Default value is 1.

select modified-e-weighted noise shaping dither

=item B<improved_e_weighted>

select improved-e-weighted noise shaping dither


=back



=item B<resampler>

Set resampling engine. Default value is swr.

Supported values:

=over 4


=item B<swr>

select the native SW Resampler; filter options precision and cheby are not
applicable in this case.

=item B<soxr>

select the SoX Resampler (where available); compensation, and filter options
filter_size, phase_shift, filter_type & kaiser_beta, are not applicable in this
case.

=back



=item B<filter_size>

For swr only, set resampling filter size, default value is 32.


=item B<phase_shift>

For swr only, set resampling phase shift, default value is 10, and must be in
the interval [0,30].


=item B<linear_interp>

Use Linear Interpolation if set to 1, default value is 0.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency (swr: 6dB point; soxr: 0dB point) ratio; must be a float
value between 0 and 1.  Default value is 0.97 with swr, and 0.91 with soxr
(which, with a sample-rate of 44100, preserves the entire audio band to 20kHz).


=item B<precision>

For soxr only, the precision in bits to which the resampled signal will be
calculated.  The default value of 20 (which, with suitable dithering, is
appropriate for a destination bit-depth of 16) gives SoX's 'High Quality'; a
value of 28 gives SoX's 'Very High Quality'.


=item B<cheby>

For soxr only, selects passband rolloff none (Chebyshev) & higher-precision
approximation for 'irrational' ratios. Default value is 0.


=item B<async>

For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps using stretching,
squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting this to 1 will enable filling and
trimming, larger values represent the maximum amount in samples that the data
may be stretched or squeezed for each second.
Default value is 0, thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
the audio timestamps.


=item B<first_pts>

For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The time unit is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.


=item B<min_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger stretching/squeezing/filling or trimming of the
data to make it match the timestamps. The default is that
stretching/squeezing/filling and trimming is disabled
(B<min_comp> = C<FLT_MAX>).


=item B<min_hard_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples to make it match the
timestamps.  This option effectively is a threshold to select between
hard (trim/fill) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation. Note that
all compensation is by default disabled through B<min_comp>.
The default is 0.1.


=item B<comp_duration>

For swr only, set duration (in seconds) over which data is stretched/squeezed
to make it match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value,
default value is 1.0.


=item B<max_soft_comp>

For swr only, set maximum factor by which data is stretched/squeezed to make it
match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value, default value
is 0.

=over 4


=item B<cubic>

select cubic

=item B<blackman_nuttall>

select Blackman Nuttall Windowed Sinc

=item B<kaiser>

select Kaiser Windowed Sinc

=back



=item B<kaiser_beta>

For swr only, set Kaiser Window Beta value. Must be an integer in the
interval [2,16], default value is 9.


=item B<output_sample_bits>

For swr only, set number of used output sample bits for dithering. Must be an integer in the
interval [0,64], default value is 0, which means it's not used.

=head1 FILTERING INTRODUCTION


Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.

	
	                [main]
	input --> split ---------------------> overlay --> output
	            |                             ^
	            |[tmp]                  [flip]|
	            +-----> crop --> vflip -------+


This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT


The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.

Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
I<crop,vflip> are in one linear chain, I<split> and
I<overlay> are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels I<[main]> and I<[tmp]>.

The stream sent to the second output of I<split>, labelled as
I<[tmp]>, is processed through the I<crop> filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
I<overlay> filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as I<[main]>), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the I<crop,vflip> filterchain.

Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.

There exist so-called I<source filters> that do not have an
audio/video input, and I<sink filters> that will not have audio/video
output.



=head1 GRAPH


The F<graph2dot> program included in the FFmpeg F<tools>
directory can be used to parse a filtergraph description and issue a
corresponding textual representation in the dot language.

Invoke the command:
	
	graph2dot -h


to see how to use F<graph2dot>.

You can then pass the dot description to the F<dot> program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.

For example the sequence of commands:
	
	echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \
	tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
	dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
	display graph.png


can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the I<GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
	
	ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

your I<GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> string will need to be of the form:
	
	nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

you may also need to set the I<nullsrc> parameters and add a I<format>
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.



=head1 FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION


A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.

Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.

A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter with no
output pads is called a "sink".



=head2 Filtergraph syntax


A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is
recognized by the B<-filter>/B<-vf> and B<-filter_complex>
options in B<ffmpeg> and B<-vf> in B<ffplay>, and by the
C<avfilter_graph_parse()>/C<avfilter_graph_parse2()> functions defined in
F<libavfilter/avfilter.h>.

A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of ","-separated filter descriptions.

A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of ";"-separated filterchain
descriptions.

A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[I<in_link_1>]...[I<in_link_N>]I<filter_name>=I<arguments>[I<out_link_1>]...[I<out_link_M>]

I<filter_name> is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program.
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=I<arguments>".

I<arguments> is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:

=over 4



=item *

A ':'-separated list of I<key=value> pairs.


=item *

A ':'-separated list of I<value>. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the C<fade> filter
declares three options in this order -- B<type>, B<start_frame> and
B<nb_frames>. Then the parameter list I<in:0:30> means that the value
I<in> is assigned to the option B<type>, I<0> to
B<start_frame> and I<30> to B<nb_frames>.


=item *

A ':'-separated list of mixed direct I<value> and long I<key=value>
pairs. The direct I<value> must precede the I<key=value> pairs, and
follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
I<key=value> pairs can be set in any preferred order.


=back


If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the C<format> filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
'|'.

The list of arguments can be quoted using the character "'" as initial
and ending mark, and the character '\' for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
"[]=;,") is encountered.

The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels I<in_link_1>
... I<in_link_N>, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels I<out_link_1> ... I<out_link_M>, are
associated to the output pads.

When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.

If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain
	
	nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
"L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled "L2", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.

In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.

Libavfilter will automatically insert B<scale> filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
C<sws_flags=I<flags>;>
to the filtergraph description.

Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:
	
	<NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
	<LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
	<LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
	<FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (possibly quoted)
	<FILTER>           ::= [<LINKLABELS>] <NAME> ["=" <FILTER_ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKLABELS>]
	<FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
	<FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]



=head2 Notes on filtergraph escaping


Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See B<the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual> for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.

A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character C<:> used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters C<\'>.

A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters C<\'> or the special
characters C<[],;> used by the filtergraph description.

Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.

For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the B<drawtext> filter description B<text> value:
	
	this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters


This string contains the C<'> special escaping character, and the
C<:> special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:
	
	text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters


A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
	
	drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

(note that in addition to the C<\'> escaping special characters,
also C<,> needs to be escaped).

Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
C<\> is special and needs to be escaped with another C<\>, the
previous string will finally result in:
	
	-vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"



=head1 TIMELINE EDITING


Some filters support a generic B<enable> option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.

The expression accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<t>

timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown


=item B<n>

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0


=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown

=back


Additionally, these filters support an B<enable> command that can be used
to re-define the expression.

Like any other filtering option, the B<enable> option follows the same
rules.

For example, to enable a blur filter (B<smartblur>) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a B<curves> filter starting at 3 seconds:
	
	smartblur = enable='between(t,10,3*60)',
	curves    = enable='gte(t,3)' : preset=cross_process




=head1 AUDIO FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using C<--disable-filters>.
The configure output will show the audio filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.


=head2 aconvert


Convert the input audio format to the specified formats.

I<This filter is deprecated. Use> B<aformat> I<instead.>

The filter accepts a string of the form:
"I<sample_format>:I<channel_layout>".

I<sample_format> specifies the sample format, and can be a string or the
corresponding numeric value defined in F<libavutil/samplefmt.h>. Use 'p'
suffix for a planar sample format.

I<channel_layout> specifies the channel layout, and can be a string
or the corresponding number value defined in F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.

The special parameter "auto", signifies that the filter will
automatically select the output format depending on the output filter.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Convert input to float, planar, stereo:
	
	aconvert=fltp:stereo



=item *

Convert input to unsigned 8-bit, automatically select out channel layout:
	
	aconvert=u8:auto


=back



=head2 adelay


Delay one or more audio channels.

Samples in delayed channel are filled with silence.

The filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<delays>

Set list of delays in milliseconds for each channel separated by '|'.
At least one delay greater than 0 should be provided.
Unused delays will be silently ignored. If number of given delays is
smaller than number of channels all remaining channels will not be delayed.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Delay first channel by 1.5 seconds, the third channel by 0.5 seconds and leave
the second channel (and any other channels that may be present) unchanged.
	
	adelay=1500|0|500


=back



=head2 aecho


Apply echoing to the input audio.

Echoes are reflected sound and can occur naturally amongst mountains
(and sometimes large buildings) when talking or shouting; digital echo
effects emulate this behaviour and are often used to help fill out the
sound of a single instrument or vocal. The time difference between the
original signal and the reflection is the C<delay>, and the
loudness of the reflected signal is the C<decay>.
Multiple echoes can have different delays and decays.

A description of the accepted parameters follows.


=over 4


=item B<in_gain>

Set input gain of reflected signal. Default is C<0.6>.


=item B<out_gain>

Set output gain of reflected signal. Default is C<0.3>.


=item B<delays>

Set list of time intervals in milliseconds between original signal and reflections
separated by '|'. Allowed range for each C<delay> is C<(0 - 90000.0]>.
Default is C<1000>.


=item B<decays>

Set list of loudnesses of reflected signals separated by '|'.
Allowed range for each C<decay> is C<(0 - 1.0]>.
Default is C<0.5>.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Make it sound as if there are twice as many instruments as are actually playing:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.88:60:0.4



=item *

If delay is very short, then it sound like a (metallic) robot playing music:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.88:6:0.4



=item *

A longer delay will sound like an open air concert in the mountains:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.9:1000:0.3



=item *

Same as above but with one more mountain:
	
	aecho=0.8:0.9:1000|1800:0.3|0.25


=back



=head2 aeval


Modify an audio signal according to the specified expressions.

This filter accepts one or more expressions (one for each channel),
which are evaluated and used to modify a corresponding audio signal.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<exprs>

Set the '|'-separated expressions list for each separate channel. If
the number of input channels is greater than the number of
expressions, the last specified expression is used for the remaining
output channels.


=item B<channel_layout, c>

Set output channel layout. If not specified, the channel layout is
specified by the number of expressions. If set to B<same>, it will
use by default the same input channel layout.

number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0


=item B<s>

sample rate

=item *

Half volume:
	
	aeval=val(ch)/2:c=same



=item *

Invert phase of the second channel:
	
	eval=val(0)|-val(1)

=head2 amerge


Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<inputs>

Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.


=back


If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.

For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input
is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.

All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the
shortest.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Merge two mono files into a stereo stream:
	
	amovie=left.wav [l] ; amovie=right.mp3 [r] ; [l] [r] amerge



=item *

Multiple merges assuming 1 video stream and 6 audio streams in F<input.mkv>:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex "[0:1][0:2][0:3][0:4][0:5][0:6] amerge=inputs=6" -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv


=back



=head2 amix


Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

Note that this filter only supports float samples (the I<amerge>
and I<pan> audio filters support many formats). If the I<amix>
input has integer samples then B<aresample> will be automatically
inserted to perform the conversion to float samples.

For example
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same duration as the
first input and a dropout transition time of 3 seconds.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<inputs>

The number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.


=item B<duration>

=head2 apad


Pad the end of an audio stream with silence.

This can be used together with B<ffmpeg> B<-shortest> to
extend audio streams to the same length as the video stream.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<packet_size>

Set silence packet size. Default value is 4096.


=item B<pad_len>

Set the number of samples of silence to add to the end. After the
value is reached, the stream is terminated. This option is mutually
exclusive with B<whole_len>.


=item B<whole_len>

Set the minimum total number of samples in the output audio stream. If
the value is longer than the input audio length, silence is added to
the end, until the value is reached. This option is mutually exclusive
with B<pad_len>.

=back


If neither the B<pad_len> nor the B<whole_len> option is
set, the filter will add silence to the end of the input stream
indefinitely.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Add 1024 samples of silence to the end of the input:
	
	apad=pad_len=1024



=item *

Make sure the audio output will contain at least 10000 samples, pad
the input with silence if required:
	
	apad=whole_len=10000



=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> to pad the audio input with silence, so that the
video stream will always result the shortest and will be converted
until the end in the output file when using the B<shortest>
option:
	
	ffmpeg -i VIDEO -i AUDIO -filter_complex "[1:0]apad" -shortest OUTPUT


=back



=head2 aphaser

=back


=back




=head2 aresample


Resample the input audio to the specified parameters, using the
libswresample library. If none are specified then the filter will
automatically convert between its input and output.

This filter is also able to stretch/squeeze the audio data to make it match
the timestamps or to inject silence / cut out audio to make it match the
timestamps, do a combination of both or do neither.

The filter accepts the syntax
[I<sample_rate>:]I<resampler_options>, where I<sample_rate>
expresses a sample rate and I<resampler_options> is a list of
I<key>=I<value> pairs, separated by ":". See the
ffmpeg-resampler manual for the complete list of supported options.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Resample the input audio to 44100Hz:
	
	aresample=44100



=item *

Stretch/squeeze samples to the given timestamps, with a maximum of 1000
samples per second compensation:
	
	aresample=async=1000


=back



=head2 asetnsamples


Set the number of samples per each output audio frame.

The last output packet may contain a different number of samples, as
the filter will flush all the remaining samples when the input audio
signal its end.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<nb_out_samples, n>

Set the number of frames per each output audio frame. The number is
intended as the number of samples I<per each channel>.
Default value is 1024.


=item B<pad, p>

If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio frame with zeroes, so
that the last frame will contain the same number of samples as the
previous ones. Default value is 1.

=back


For example, to set the number of per-frame samples to 1234 and
disable padding for the last frame, use:
	
	asetnsamples=n=1234:p=0



=head2 asetrate


Set the sample rate without altering the PCM data.
This will result in a change of speed and pitch.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sample_rate, r>

Set the output sample rate. Default is 44100 Hz.

=back



=head2 ashowinfo

The shown line contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form
I<key>:I<value>.

The following values are shown in the output:


=over 4


=item B<n>

Statistics are calculated and displayed for each audio channel and,
where applicable, an overall figure is also given.

It accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<length>

I<Min level> or I<Max level>.

=back



=head2 astreamsync


Forward two audio streams and control the order the buffers are forwarded.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<expr, e>

Set the expression deciding which stream should be
forwarded next: if the result is negative, the first stream is forwarded; if
the result is positive or zero, the second stream is forwarded. It can use
the following variables:


=over 4


=item I<b1 b2>

number of buffers forwarded so far on each stream

=item I<s1 s2>

number of samples forwarded so far on each stream

=item I<t1 t2>

current timestamp of each stream

=back


The default value is C<t1-t2>, which means to always forward the stream
that has a smaller timestamp.

=back



=head3 Examples


Stress-test C<amerge> by randomly sending buffers on the wrong
input, while avoiding too much of a desynchronization:
	
	amovie=file.ogg [a] ; amovie=file.mp3 [b] ;
	[a] [b] astreamsync=(2*random(1))-1+tanh(5*(t1-t2)) [a2] [b2] ;
	[a2] [b2] amerge



=head2 asyncts


Synchronize audio data with timestamps by squeezing/stretching it and/or
dropping samples/adding silence when needed.

This filter is not built by default, please use B<aresample> to do squeezing/stretching.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<compensate>

Enable stretching/squeezing the data to make it match the timestamps. Disabled
by default. When disabled, time gaps are covered with silence.


=item B<min_delta>

The minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in seconds) to trigger
adding/dropping samples. The default value is 0.1. If you get an imperfect
sync with this filter, try setting this parameter to 0.


=item B<max_comp>

The maximum compensation in samples per second. Only relevant with compensate=1.
The default value is 500.


=item B<first_pts>

Assume that the first PTS should be this value. The time base is 1 / sample
rate. This allows for padding/trimming at the start of the stream. By default,
no assumption is made about the first frame's expected PTS, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative PTS due to encoder delay.


=back



=head2 atempo


Adjust audio tempo.

The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not
specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must
be in the [0.5, 2.0] range.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Slow down audio to 80% tempo:
	
	atempo=0.8



=item *

To speed up audio to 125% tempo:
	
	atempo=1.25


=back



=head2 atrim


Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio
sample with the timestamp I<start> will be the first sample in the output.


=item B<end>

Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the
audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp I<end> will be
the last sample in the output.


=item B<start_pts>

Same as I<start>, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples
instead of seconds.


=item B<end_pts>

Same as I<end>, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead
of seconds.


=item B<duration>

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.


=item B<start_sample>

The number of the first sample that should be output.


=item B<end_sample>

The number of the first sample that should be dropped.

=back


B<start>, B<end>, B<duration> are expressed as time
duration specifications, check the "Time duration" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the B<duration>
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

Drop everything except the second minute of input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=60:120



=item *

Keep only the first 1000 samples:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -af atrim=end_sample=1000



=back



=head2 bandpass


Apply a two-pole Butterworth band-pass filter with central
frequency I<frequency>, and (3dB-point) band-width width.
The I<csg> option selects a constant skirt gain (peak gain = Q)
instead of the default: constant 0dB peak gain.
The filter roll off at 6dB per octave (20dB per decade).

shelving filter with a response similar to that of a standard
hi-fi's tone-controls. This is also known as shelving equalisation (EQ).

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<gain, g>

Give the gain at 0 Hz. Its useful range is about -20
(for a large cut) to +20 (for a large boost).
Beware of clipping when using a positive gain.


=item B<frequency, f>

Set the filter's central frequency and so can be used
to extend or reduce the frequency range to be boosted or cut.

=head2 channelmap


Remap input channels to new locations.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<channel_layout>

The channel layout of the output stream.


=item B<map>

Map channels from input to output. The argument is a '|'-separated list of
mappings, each in the C<I<in_channel>-I<out_channel>> or
I<in_channel> form. I<in_channel> can be either the name of the input
channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the input channel layout.
I<out_channel> is the name of the output channel or its index in the output
channel layout. If I<out_channel> is not given then it is implicitly an
index, starting with zero and increasing by one for each mapping.

=back


If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels to
output channels, preserving indices.

For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file,
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter 'channelmap=map=DL-FL|DR-FR' out.wav

will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix channels of
the input.

To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC's native channel order
	
	ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter 'channelmap=1|2|0|5|3|4:channel_layout=5.1' out.wav



=head2 channelsplit


Split each channel from an input audio stream into a separate output stream.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<channel_layout>

The channel layout of the input stream. The default is "stereo".

=back


For example, assuming a stereo input MP3 file,
	
	ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -filter_complex channelsplit out.mkv

will create an output Matroska file with two audio streams, one containing only
the left channel and the other the right channel.

Split a 5.1 WAV file into per-channel files:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex
	'channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]'
	-map '[FL]' front_left.wav -map '[FR]' front_right.wav -map '[FC]'
	front_center.wav -map '[LFE]' lfe.wav -map '[SL]' side_left.wav -map '[SR]'
	side_right.wav



=head2 compand

Compress or expand the audio's dynamic range.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<attacks>


=item B<decays>

A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. I<attacks> refers to
increase of volume and I<decays> refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.


=item B<points>

A list of points for the transfer function, specified in dB relative to the
maximum possible signal amplitude. Each key points list must be defined using
the following syntax: C<x0/y0|x1/y1|x2/y2|....> or
C<x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ....>

The input values must be in strictly increasing order but the transfer function
does not have to be monotonically rising. The point C<0/0> is assumed but
may be overridden (by C<0/out-dBn>). Typical values for the transfer
function are C<-70/-70|-60/-20>.


=item B<soft-knee>

Set the curve radius in dB for all joints. It defaults to 0.01.


=item B<gain>

Set the additional gain in dB to be applied at all points on the transfer
function. This allows for easy adjustment of the overall gain.
It defaults to 0.


=item B<volume>

Set an initial volume, in dB, to be assumed for each channel when filtering
starts. This permits the user to supply a nominal level initially, so that, for
example, a very large gain is not applied to initial signal levels before the
companding has begun to operate. A typical value for audio which is initially
quiet is -90 dB. It defaults to 0.


=item B<delay>

Set a delay, in seconds. The input audio is analyzed immediately, but audio is
delayed before being fed to the volume adjuster. Specifying a delay
approximately equal to the attack/decay times allows the filter to effectively
operate in predictive rather than reactive mode. It defaults to 0.


=back

=head2 earwax


Make audio easier to listen to on headphones.

This filter adds `cues' to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD format) audio
so that when listened to on headphones the stereo image is moved from
inside your head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of
the listener (standard for speakers).

Ported from SoX.


=head2 equalizer


Apply a two-pole peaking equalisation (EQ) filter. With this
filter, the signal-level at and around a selected frequency can
be increased or decreased, whilst (unlike bandpass and bandreject

form. I<input_idx> is the 0-based index of the input stream. I<in_channel>
can be either the name of the input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its
index in the specified input stream. I<out_channel> is the name of the output
channel.

=back


The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when they are not specified
explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused matching input channel
and if that fails it picks the first unused input channel.

Join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts):
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT


Build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:
	
	ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
	'join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL|1.0-FR|2.0-FC|3.0-SL|4.0-SR|5.0-LFE'
	out



=head2 ladspa


Load a LADSPA (Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API) plugin.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-ladspa>.


=over 4


=item B<file, f>

Specifies the name of LADSPA plugin library to load. If the environment
variable B<LADSPA_PATH> is defined, the LADSPA plugin is searched in
each one of the directories specified by the colon separated list in
B<LADSPA_PATH>, otherwise in the standard LADSPA paths, which are in
this order: F<HOME/.ladspa/lib/>, F</usr/local/lib/ladspa/>,
F</usr/lib/ladspa/>.


=item B<plugin, p>

Specifies the plugin within the library. Some libraries contain only
one plugin, but others contain many of them. If this is not set filter
will list all available plugins within the specified library.


=item B<controls, c>

Set the '|' separated list of controls which are zero or more floating point
values that determine the behavior of the loaded plugin (for example delay,
threshold or gain).
Controls need to be defined using the following syntax:
c0=I<value0>|c1=I<value1>|c2=I<value2>|..., where
I<valuei> is the value set on the I<i>-th control.
If B<controls> is set to C<help>, all available controls and
their valid ranges are printed.


=item B<sample_rate, s>

Specify the sample rate, default to 44100. Only used if plugin have
zero inputs.


=item B<nb_samples, n>

Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame, default
is 1024. Only used if plugin have zero inputs.


=item B<duration, d>

Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See the function
C<av_parse_time()> for the accepted format, also check the "Time duration"
section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.
Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified duration,
as the generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.
If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio is
supposed to be generated forever.
Only used if plugin have zero inputs.


=back



=head3 Examples

=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<cN>

Modify the I<N>-th control value.

If the specified value is not valid, it is ignored and prior one is kept.

=back



=head2 lowpass


Apply a low-pass filter with 3dB point frequency.
The filter can be either single-pole or double-pole (the default).
The filter roll off at 6dB per pole per octave (20dB per pole per decade).

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<frequency, f>

Set frequency in Hz. Default is 500.


=item B<poles, p>

Set number of poles. Default is 2.


=item B<width_type>

Set method to specify band-width of filter.

=over 4


=item B<h>

Hz

=item B<q>

Q-Factor

=item B<o>

octave

=item B<s>

slope

=back



=item B<width, w>

Specify the band-width of a filter in width_type units.
Applies only to double-pole filter.
The default is 0.707q and gives a Butterworth response.

=back



=head2 pan


Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output
channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

This filter is also designed to remap efficiently the channels of an audio
stream.

The filter accepts parameters of the form:
"I<l>:I<outdef>:I<outdef>:..."


=over 4


=item B<l>

output channel layout or number of channels


=item B<outdef>

output channel specification, of the form:
"I<out_name>=[I<gain>*]I<in_name>[+[I<gain>*]I<in_name>...]"


=item B<out_name>

output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a channel
number (c0, c1, etc.)


=item B<gain>

multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume unchanged


=item B<in_name>

input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible to mix
named and numbered input channels

=back


If the `=' in a channel specification is replaced by `E<lt>', then the gains for
that specification will be renormalized so that the total is 1, thus
avoiding clipping noise.


=head3 Mixing examples


For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a bigger
factor for the left channel:
	
	pan=1:c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1


A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5- and
7-channels surround:
	
	pan=stereo: FL < FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL : FR < FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR


Note that B<ffmpeg> integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system
that should be preferred (see "-ac" option) unless you have very specific
needs.


=head3 Remapping examples


The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:


=over 4


=item *<gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,>


=item *<only one input per channel output,>


=back


If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user ("Pure
channel mapping detected"), and use an optimized and lossless method to do the
remapping.

For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
dropping the extra channels:
	
	pan="stereo: c0=FL : c1=FR"


Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right channels
and keep the input channel layout:
	
	pan="5.1: c0=c1 : c1=c0 : c2=c2 : c3=c3 : c4=c4 : c5=c5"


If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left channel (and
still keep the stereo channel layout) with:
	
	pan="stereo:c1=c1"


Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel in both
front left and right:
	
	pan="stereo: c0=FR : c1=FR"



=head2 replaygain


ReplayGain scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as an input and
outputs it unchanged.
At end of filtering it displays C<track_gain> and C<track_peak>.


=head2 resample


Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. It is
not meant to be used directly.


=head2 silencedetect


Detect silence in an audio stream.

This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume is less
or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or equal to the
minimum detected noise duration.

The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<duration, d>

Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).


=item B<noise, n>

=back



=head2 treble


Boost or cut treble (upper) frequencies of the audio using a two-pole
shelving filter with a response similar to that of a standard
hi-fi's tone-controls. This is also known as shelving equalisation (EQ).

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<gain, g>

Give the gain at whichever is the lower of ~22 kHz and the
Nyquist frequency. Its useful range is about -20 (for a large cut)
to +20 (for a large boost). Beware of clipping when using a positive gain.

	<output_volume> = <volume> * <input_volume>


The default value for I<volume> is "1.0".


=item B<precision>

This parameter represents the mathematical precision.

It determines which input sample formats will be allowed, which affects the
precision of the volume scaling.


=over 4


=item B<fixed>

Note that when B<eval> is set to B<once> only the
I<sample_rate> and I<tb> variables are available, all other
variables will evaluate to NAN.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<volume>

Modify the volume expression.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current

=over 4


=item *

Halve the input audio volume:
	
	volume=volume=0.5
	volume=volume=1/2
	volume=volume=-6.0206dB


In all the above example the named key for B<volume> can be
omitted, for example like in:
	
	volume=0.5



=item *

Increase input audio power by 6 decibels using fixed-point precision:
	
	volume=volume=6dB:precision=fixed



=item *

Fade volume after time 10 with an annihilation period of 5 seconds:
	
	volume='if(lt(t,10),1,max(1-(t-10)/5,0))':eval=frame


=back



=head2 volumedetect


Detect the volume of the input video.

The filter has no parameters. The input is not modified. Statistics about
the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end is reached.

In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of a histogram of the
registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated 1/1000 of
the samples).

All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.


=head3 Examples


Here is an excerpt of the output:
	
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
	[Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409


It means that:

=over 4


=item *

The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.

=item *

The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and -5 dB.

=item *

There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

=back


In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.



=head1 AUDIO SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.


=head2 abuffer


Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular

=item B<channel_layout>

The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers.
Either a channel layout name from channel_layout_map in
F<libavutil/channel_layout.c> or its corresponding integer representation

=item B<channels>

The number of channels of the incoming audio buffers.
If both I<channels> and I<channel_layout> are specified, then they
must be consistent.


=back



=head3 Examples


	
	abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=s16p:channel_layout=stereo


will instruct the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at 44100Hz.
Since the sample format with name "s16p" corresponds to the number
6 and the "stereo" channel layout corresponds to the value 0x3, this is
equivalent to:
	
	abuffer=sample_rate=44100:sample_fmt=6:channel_layout=0x3



=head2 aevalsrc


Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.

This source accepts in input one or more expressions (one for each
channel), which are evaluated and used to generate a corresponding
audio signal.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<exprs>

Set the '|'-separated expressions list for each separate channel. In case the
B<channel_layout> option is not specified, the selected channel layout
depends on the number of provided expressions. Otherwise the last
specified expression is applied to the remaining output channels.


=item B<channel_layout, c>

Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the specified layout
must be equal to the number of specified expressions.


=item B<duration, d>

Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See the function
C<av_parse_time()> for the accepted format.
Note that the resulting duration may be greater than the specified

=back




=head1 AUDIO SINKS


Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.


=head2 abuffersink


Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter chain.

This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in F<libavfilter/buffersink.h>
or the options system.

It accepts a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which
defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to C<avfilter_init_filter> for initialization.

=head2 anullsink


Null audio sink; do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is
mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging
tools.



=head1 VIDEO FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
existing filters using C<--disable-filters>.
The configure output will show the video filters included in your
build.

Below is a description of the currently available video filters.


=head2 alphaextract


Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
is especially useful with the I<alphamerge> filter.


=head2 alphamerge


Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
I<alphaextract> to allow the transmission or storage of frame
sequences that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha
channel.

For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
and a separate video created with I<alphaextract>, you might use:
	
	movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]


Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame
sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either
input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding
pipeline drops frames. If you're trying to apply an image as an
overlay to a video stream, consider the I<overlay> filter instead.


=head2 ass


Same as the B<subtitles> filter, except that it doesn't require libavcodec
and libavformat to work. On the other hand, it is limited to ASS (Advanced
Substation Alpha) subtitles files.


=head2 bbox


Compute the bounding box for the non-black pixels in the input frame
luminance plane.

This filter computes the bounding box containing all the pixels with a
luminance value greater than the minimum allowed value.
The parameters describing the bounding box are printed on the filter
log.

The filter accepts the following option:


=over 4


=item B<min_val>

Set the minimal luminance value. Default is C<16>.

=back



=head2 blackdetect


Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be
useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid
recordings. Output lines contains the time for the start, end and
duration of the detected black interval expressed in seconds.

In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<black_min_duration, d>

Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It must
be a non-negative floating point number.

Default value is 2.0.


=item B<picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th>

Set the threshold for considering a picture "black".
Express the minimum value for the ratio:
	
	<nb_black_pixels> / <nb_pixels>


for which a picture is considered black.
Default value is 0.98.


=item B<pixel_black_th, pix_th>

Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which a
pixel is considered "black". The provided value is scaled according to
the following equation:
	
	<absolute_threshold> = <luminance_minimum_value> + <pixel_black_th> * <luminance_range_size>


I<luminance_range_size> and I<luminance_minimum_value> depend on
the input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range
formats and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

Default value is 0.10.

The vertical position, in the input video, of the top edge of the output video.
It defaults to C<(in_h-out_h)/2>.
This expression is evaluated per-frame.

=back


The expression for I<out_w> may depend on the value of I<out_h>,
and the expression for I<out_h> may depend on I<out_w>, but they
cannot depend on I<x> and I<y>, as I<x> and I<y> are
evaluated after I<out_w> and I<out_h>.

The I<x> and I<y> parameters specify the expressions for the
position of the top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They
are evaluated for each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it
is approximated to the nearest valid value.

The expression for I<x> may depend on I<y>, and the expression
for I<y> may depend on I<x>.

=head2 cropdetect


Auto-detect the crop size.

It calculates the necessary cropping parameters and prints the
recommended parameters via the logging system. The detected dimensions
correspond to the non-black area of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<limit>

Set higher black value threshold, which can be optionally specified
from nothing (0) to everything (255). An intensity value greater
to the set value is considered non-black. It defaults to 24.


=item B<round>

The value which the width/height should be divisible by. It defaults to
16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2 to
get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best when
encoding to most video codecs.


=item B<reset_count, reset>

Set the counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will
reset the previously detected largest video area and start over to
detect the current optimal crop area. Default value is 0.

This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
indicates 'never reset', and returns the largest area encountered during
playback.

=back




=head2 curves


Apply color adjustments using curves.

This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by I<N> key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.

By default, a component curve is defined by the two points I<(0;0)> and
I<(1;1)>. This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
"adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image.

The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve (using a natural cubic spline interpolation) will be define to pass
smoothly through all these new coordinates. The new defined points needs to be
strictly increasing over the x-axis, and their I<x> and I<y> values must
be in the I<[0;1]> interval.  If the computed curves happened to go outside
the vector spaces, the values will be clipped accordingly.

If there is no key point defined in C<x=0>, the filter will automatically
insert a I<(0;0)> point. In the same way, if there is no key point defined
in C<x=1>, the filter will automatically insert a I<(1;1)> point.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<preset>

Select one of the available color presets. This option can be used in addition
to the B<r>, B<g>, B<b> parameters; in this case, the later
options takes priority on the preset values.
Available presets are:

=item B<color_negative>


=item B<cross_process>


=item B<darker>


=item B<increase_contrast>


=item B<lighter>


=item B<linear_contrast>


=item B<medium_contrast>


=item B<negative>


=item B<strong_contrast>


=item B<vintage>


=back

Default is C<none>.

=item B<master, m>

Set the master key points. These points will define a second pass mapping. It
is sometimes called a "luminance" or "value" mapping. It can be used with
B<r>, B<g>, B<b> or B<all> since it acts like a
post-processing LUT.

=item B<red, r>

Set the key points for the red component.

=item B<green, g>

Set the key points for the green component.

=item B<blue, b>

Set the key points for the blue component.

=item B<all>

Set the key points for all components (not including master).
Can be used in addition to the other key points component
options. In this case, the unset component(s) will fallback on this
B<all> setting.

=item B<psfile>

Specify a Photoshop curves file (C<.asv>) to import the settings from.

=back


To avoid some filtergraph syntax conflicts, each key points list need to be
defined using the following syntax: C<x0/y0 x1/y1 x2/y2 ...>.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Increase slightly the middle level of blue:
	
	curves=blue='0.5/0.58'

	curves=r='0/0.11 .42/.51 1/0.95':g='0.50/0.48':b='0/0.22 .49/.44 1/0.8'

Here we obtain the following coordinates for each components:

=over 4


=item I<red>

C<(0;0.11) (0.42;0.51) (1;0.95)>

=item I<green>

C<(0;0) (0.50;0.48) (1;1)>

	curves=psfile='MyCurvesPresets/purple.asv':green='0.45/0.53'


=back



=head2 dctdnoiz


Denoise frames using 2D DCT (frequency domain filtering).

This filter is not designed for real time.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<sigma, s>

Set the noise sigma constant.

This I<sigma> defines a hard threshold of C<3 * sigma>; every DCT
coefficient (absolute value) below this threshold with be dropped.

If you need a more advanced filtering, see B<expr>.

Default is C<0>.


=item B<overlap>

Set number overlapping pixels for each block. Since the filter can be slow, you
may want to reduce this value, at the cost of a less effective filter and the
risk of various artefacts.

If the overlapping value doesn't allow to process the whole input width or
height, a warning will be displayed and according borders won't be denoised.

Default value is I<blocksize>-1, which is the best possible setting.


=item B<expr, e>

Set the coefficient factor expression.

For each coefficient of a DCT block, this expression will be evaluated as a
multiplier value for the coefficient.

If this is option is set, the B<sigma> option will be ignored.

The absolute value of the coefficient can be accessed through the I<c>
variable.


=item B<n>

Set the I<blocksize> using the number of bits. C<1E<lt>E<lt>I<n>> defines the
I<blocksize>, which is the width and height of the processed blocks.

The default value is I<3> (8x8) and can be raised to I<4> for a
I<blocksize> of 16x16. Note that changing this setting has huge consequences
on the speed processing. Also, a larger block size does not necessarily means a
better de-noising.

=back



=head3 Examples


Apply a denoise with a B<sigma> of C<4.5>:
	
	dctdnoiz=4.5


The same operation can be achieved using the expression system:
	
	dctdnoiz=e='gte(c, 4.5*3)'


Violent denoise using a block size of C<16x16>:
	
	dctdnoiz=15:n=4




=head2 decimate


Drop duplicated frames at regular intervals.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<cycle>

Set the number of frames from which one will be dropped. Setting this to
I<N> means one frame in every batch of I<N> frames will be dropped.
Default is C<5>.


=item B<dupthresh>

Set the threshold for duplicate detection. If the difference metric for a frame
is less than or equal to this value, then it is declared as duplicate. Default
is C<1.1>


=item B<scthresh>

Set scene change threshold. Default is C<15>.


=item B<blockx>


=item B<blocky>

Set the size of the x and y-axis blocks used during metric calculations.
Larger blocks give better noise suppression, but also give worse detection of
small movements. Must be a power of two. Default is C<32>.


=item B<ppsrc>

Mark main input as a pre-processed input and activate clean source input
stream. This allows the input to be pre-processed with various filters to help
the metrics calculation while keeping the frame selection lossless. When set to
C<1>, the first stream is for the pre-processed input, and the second
stream is the clean source from where the kept frames are chosen. Default is
C<0>.


=item B<chroma>

Set whether or not chroma is considered in the metric calculations. Default is
C<1>.

=back



=head2 dejudder


Remove judder produced by partially interlaced telecined content.

Judder can be introduced, for instance, by B<pullup> filter. If the original
source was partially telecined content then the output of C<pullup,dejudder>
will have a variable frame rate. May change the recorded frame rate of the
container. Aside from that change, this filter will not affect constant frame
rate video.

The option available in this filter is:

=over 4



=item B<cycle>

Specify the length of the window over which the judder repeats.

Accepts any integer greater than 1. Useful values are:

=over 4



=item B<4>

=item B<y>

Specify the top left corner coordinates of the logo. They must be
specified.


=item B<w>


=item B<h>

Specify the width and height of the logo to clear. They must be
specified.


=item B<band, t>

Specify the thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to
I<w> and I<h>). The default value is 4.


=item B<show>

When set to 1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify
finding the right I<x>, I<y>, I<w>, and I<h> parameters.
The default value is 0.

The rectangle is drawn on the outermost pixels which will be (partly)
replaced with interpolated values. The values of the next pixels
immediately outside this rectangle in each direction will be used to
compute the interpolated pixel values inside the rectangle.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4

and height. These parameters have the same meaning as the drawbox
filter which can be used to visualise the position of the bounding
box.

This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects within the frame
might be confused for camera motion by the motion vector search.

If any or all of I<x>, I<y>, I<w> and I<h> are set to -1
then the full frame is used. This allows later options to be set
without specifying the bounding box for the motion vector search.

Default - search the whole frame.

=item B<ry>

Specify the maximum extent of movement in x and y directions in the
range 0-64 pixels. Default 16.

upwards.


=item B<max_glyph_d, descent>

the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest grid coordinate
used to place a glyph outline point, for all the rendered glyphs.
This is a negative value, due to the grid's orientation, with the Y axis

=back




=head3 Text expansion


If B<expansion> is set to C<strftime>,
the filter recognizes strftime() sequences in the provided text and
expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of strftime(). This
feature is deprecated.

If B<expansion> is set to C<none>, the text is printed verbatim.

If B<expansion> is set to C<normal> (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.

The backslash character '\', followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.

Sequence of the form C<%{...}> are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.

Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the
B<text> option in the filter argument string and as the filter
argument in the filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell,
that makes up to four levels of escaping; using a text file avoids these
problems.

The following functions are available:


=over 4



=item B<expr, e>

The expression evaluation result.

It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the I<x> and
I<y> values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants I<text_w> and I<text_h> will have an undefined
value.


=item B<expr_int_format, eif>

Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.

First argument is expression to be evaluated, same as for I<expr> function.
Second argument specifies output format. Allowed values are 'x', 'X', 'd' and
'u', they are treated exactly as in printf function.
Third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by output.
Effectively this allows to add padding with zeros from the left.


=item B<gmtime>

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.
It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.


=item B<localtime>

The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a strftime() format string.


=item B<metadata>

Frame metadata. It must take one argument specifying metadata key.


=item B<n, frame_num>

The frame number, starting from 0.


=item B<pict_type>

A 1 character description of the current picture type.


=item B<pts>

The timestamp of the current frame.
It can take up to two arguments.

The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to C<flt>
for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; C<hms> stands
for a formatted I<[-]HH:MM:SS.mmm> timestamp with millisecond accuracy.

The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.

Specify whether to extract the top (if the value is C<0> or
C<top>) or the bottom field (if the value is C<1> or
C<bottom>).

=back



=head2 fieldmatch


Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine C<fieldmatch> needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as B<decimate> in the filtergraph.

The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
C<fieldmatch> will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as B<yadif> before decimation.

In addition to the various configuration options, C<fieldmatch> can take an
optional second stream, activated through the B<ppsrc> option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.

Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)
and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from
which C<fieldmatch> is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<order>

Specify the assumed field order of the input stream. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Auto detect parity (use FFmpeg's internal parity value).

=item B<bff>

Assume bottom field first.

=item B<tff>

Assume top field first.

=back


Note that it is sometimes recommended not to trust the parity announced by the
stream.

Default value is I<auto>.


=item B<mode>

Set the matching mode or strategy to use. B<pc> mode is the safest in the
sense that it won't risk creating jerkiness due to duplicate frames when
possible, but if there are bad edits or blended fields it will end up
outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, B<pcn_ub> mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between B<pc> and B<pcn_ub> in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

More details about p/c/n/u/b are available in B<p/c/n/u/b meaning> section.

Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<pc>

2-way matching (p/c)

=item B<pc_n>

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match if still combed (p/c + n)

=item B<pc_u>

2-way matching, and trying 3rd match (same order) if still combed (p/c + u)

=item B<pc_n_ub>

2-way matching, trying 3rd match if still combed, and trying 4th/5th matches if
still combed (p/c + n + u/b)

=item B<pcn>

3-way matching (p/c/n)

=item B<pcn_ub>

3-way matching, and trying 4th/5th matches if all 3 of the original matches are
detected as combed (p/c/n + u/b)

=back


The parenthesis at the end indicate the matches that would be used for that
mode assuming B<order>=I<tff> (and B<field> on I<auto> or
I<top>).

In terms of speed B<pc> mode is by far the fastest and B<pcn_ub> is
the slowest.

Default value is I<pc_n>.


=item B<ppsrc>

Mark the main input stream as a pre-processed input, and enable the secondary
input stream as the clean source to pick the fields from. See the filter
introduction for more details. It is similar to the B<clip2> feature from
VFM/TFM.

Default value is C<0> (disabled).


=item B<field>

Set the field to match from. It is recommended to set this to the same value as
B<order> unless you experience matching failures with that setting. In
certain circumstances changing the field that is used to match from can have a
large impact on matching performance. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<auto>

Automatic (same value as B<order>).

=item B<bottom>

Match from the bottom field.

=item B<top>

Match from the top field.

=back


Default value is I<auto>.


=item B<mchroma>

Set whether or not chroma is included during the match comparisons. In most
cases it is recommended to leave this enabled. You should set this to C<0>
only if your clip has bad chroma problems such as heavy rainbowing or other
artifacts. Setting this to C<0> could also be used to speed things up at
the cost of some accuracy.

Default value is C<1>.


=item B<y0>


=item B<y1>

These define an exclusion band which excludes the lines between B<y0> and
B<y1> from being included in the field matching decision. An exclusion
band can be used to ignore subtitles, a logo, or other things that may
interfere with the matching. B<y0> sets the starting scan line and
B<y1> sets the ending line; all lines in between B<y0> and
B<y1> (including B<y0> and B<y1>) will be ignored. Setting
B<y0> and B<y1> to the same value will disable the feature.
B<y0> and B<y1> defaults to C<0>.


=item B<scthresh>

Set the scene change detection threshold as a percentage of maximum change on
the luma plane. Good values are in the C<[8.0, 14.0]> range. Scene change
detection is only relevant in case B<combmatch>=I<sc>.  The range for
B<scthresh> is C<[0.0, 100.0]>.

Default value is C<12.0>.


=item B<combmatch>

When B<combatch> is not I<none>, C<fieldmatch> will take into
account the combed scores of matches when deciding what match to use as the
final match. Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<none>

No final matching based on combed scores.

=item B<sc>

Combed scores are only used when a scene change is detected.

=item B<full>

Use combed scores all the time.

=back


Default is I<sc>.


=item B<combdbg>

Force C<fieldmatch> to calculate the combed metrics for certain matches and
print them. This setting is known as B<micout> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.
Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<none>

No forced calculation.

=item B<pcn>

Force p/c/n calculations.

=item B<pcnub>

Force p/c/n/u/b calculations.

=back


Default value is I<none>.


=item B<cthresh>

This is the area combing threshold used for combed frame detection. This
essentially controls how "strong" or "visible" combing must be to be detected.
Larger values mean combing must be more visible and smaller values mean combing
can be less visible or strong and still be detected. Valid settings are from
C<-1> (every pixel will be detected as combed) to C<255> (no pixel will
be detected as combed). This is basically a pixel difference value. A good
range is C<[8, 12]>.

Default value is C<9>.


=item B<chroma>

Sets whether or not chroma is considered in the combed frame decision.  Only
disable this if your source has chroma problems (rainbowing, etc.) that are
causing problems for the combed frame detection with chroma enabled. Actually,
using B<chroma>=I<0> is usually more reliable, except for the case
where there is chroma only combing in the source.

Default value is C<0>.


=item B<blockx>


=item B<blocky>

Respectively set the x-axis and y-axis size of the window used during combed
frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which
B<combpel> pixels are required to be detected as combed for a frame to be
declared combed. See the B<combpel> parameter description for more info.
Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up
to 512.

Default value is C<16>.


=item B<combpel>

The number of combed pixels inside any of the B<blocky> by
B<blockx> size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as
combed. While B<cthresh> controls how "visible" the combing must be, this
setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a
window defined by the B<blockx> and B<blocky> settings) on the
frame. Minimum value is C<0> and maximum is C<blocky x blockx> (at
which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known
as B<MI> in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

Default value is C<80>.

=back




=head3 p/c/n/u/b meaning



=head4 p/c/n


We assume the following telecined stream:

	
	Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
	Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4


The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the
first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.

When C<fieldmatch> is configured to run a matching from bottom
(B<field>=I<bottom>) this is how this input stream get transformed:

	
	Input stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4
	                B     1 2 3 4 4   <-- matching reference
	
	Matches:              c c n n c
	
	Output stream:
	                T     1 2 3 4 4
	                B     1 2 3 4 4


As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.
To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter
after this operation. See for instance the B<decimate> filter.

The same operation now matching from top fields (B<field>=I<top>)
looks like this:

	
	Input stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4   <-- matching reference
	                B     1 2 3 4 4
	
	Matches:              c c p p c
	
	Output stream:
	                T     1 2 2 3 4
	                B     1 2 2 3 4


In these examples, we can see what I<p>, I<c> and I<n> mean;
basically, they refer to the frame and field of the opposite parity:


=over 4


=item *<I<p> matches the field of the opposite parity in the previous frame>


=item *<I<c> matches the field of the opposite parity in the current frame>


=item *<I<n> matches the field of the opposite parity in the next frame>


=back



=head4 u/b


The I<u> and I<b> matching are a bit special in the sense that they match
from the opposite parity flag. In the following examples, we assume that we are
currently matching the 2nd frame (Top:2, bottom:2). According to the match, a
'x' is placed above and below each matched fields.

With bottom matching (B<field>=I<bottom>):
	
	Match:           c         p           n          b          u
	
	                 x       x               x        x          x
	  Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
	  Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3
	                 x         x           x        x              x
	
	Output frames:
	                 2          1          2          2          2
	                 2          2          2          1          3


With top matching (B<field>=I<top>):
	
	Match:           c         p           n          b          u
	
	                 x         x           x        x              x
	  Top          1 2 2     1 2 2       1 2 2      1 2 2      1 2 2
	  Bottom       1 2 3     1 2 3       1 2 3      1 2 3      1 2 3

	Output frames:
	                 2          2          2          1          2
	                 2          1          3          2          2



=head3 Examples


Simple IVTC of a top field first telecined stream:
	
	fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=none, decimate


Advanced IVTC, with fallback on B<yadif> for still combed frames:
	
	fieldmatch=order=tff:combmatch=full, yadif=deint=interlaced, decimate



=head2 fieldorder


Transform the field order of the input video.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<order>

The output field order. Valid values are I<tff> for top field first or I<bff>
for bottom field first.

=back


The default value is B<tff>.

The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.

If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.

It is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material,
which is bottom field first.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv



=head2 fifo


Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.

It is mainly useful when auto-inserted by the libavfilter
framework.

It does not take parameters.



=head2 format


Convert the input video to one of the specified pixel formats.
Libavfilter will try to pick one that is suitable as input to
the next filter.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<pix_fmts>

A '|'-separated list of pixel format names, such as
"pix_fmts=yuv420p|monow|rgb24".


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Convert the input video to the I<yuv420p> format
	
	format=pix_fmts=yuv420p


Convert the input video to any of the formats in the list
	
	format=pix_fmts=yuv420p|yuv444p|yuv410p


=back




=head2 fps


Convert the video to specified constant frame rate by duplicating or dropping
frames as necessary.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<fps>

The desired output frame rate. The default is C<25>.


=item B<round>

Rounding method.

Possible values are:

=over 4


=item B<zero>

zero round towards 0

=item B<inf>

round away from 0

=item B<down>

round towards -infinity

=item B<up>

round towards +infinity

=item B<near>

round to nearest

=back

The default is C<near>.


=item B<start_time>

Assume the first PTS should be the given value, in seconds. This allows for
padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption is made
about the first frame's expected PTS, so no padding or trimming is done.
For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with duplicates of
the first frame if a video stream starts after the audio stream or to trim any
frames with a negative PTS.


=back


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
I<fps>[:I<round>].

See also the B<setpts> filter.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

A typical usage in order to set the fps to 25:
	
	fps=fps=25



=item *

Sets the fps to 24, using abbreviation and rounding method to round to nearest:
	
	fps=fps=film:round=near


=back



=head2 framepack


Pack two different video streams into a stereoscopic video, setting proper
metadata on supported codecs. The two views should have the same size and
framerate and processing will stop when the shorter video ends. Please note
that you may conveniently adjust view properties with the B<scale> and
B<fps> filters.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4



=item B<format>

The desired packing format. Supported values are:


=over 4



=item B<sbs>

The views are next to each other (default).


=item B<tab>

The views are on top of each other.


=item B<lines>

The views are packed by line.


=item B<columns>

The views are packed by column.


=item B<frameseq>

The views are temporally interleaved.


=back



=back


Some examples:

	
	# Convert left and right views into a frame-sequential video
	ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex framepack=frameseq OUTPUT
	
	# Convert views into a side-by-side video with the same output resolution as the input
	ffmpeg -i LEFT -i RIGHT -filter_complex [0:v]scale=w=iw/2[left],[1:v]scale=w=iw/2[right],[left][right]framepack=sbs OUTPUT



=head2 framestep


Select one frame every N-th frame.

This filter accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<step>

Select frame after every C<step> frames.
Allowed values are positive integers higher than 0. Default value is C<1>.

=back




=head2 frei0r


Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

To enable the compilation of this filter, you need to install the frei0r
header and configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-frei0r>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<filter_name>

The name of the frei0r effect to load. If the environment variable
B<FREI0R_PATH> is defined, the frei0r effect is searched for in each of the
directories specified by the colon-separated list in B<FREIOR_PATH>.
Otherwise, the standard frei0r paths are searched, in this order:
F<HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/>, F</usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/>,
F</usr/lib/frei0r-1/>.


=item B<filter_params>

A '|'-separated list of parameters to pass to the frei0r effect.


=back


A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (its value is either
"y" or "n"), a double, a color (specified as
I<R>/I<G>/I<B>, where I<R>, I<G>, and I<B> are floating point
numbers between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive) or by a color description specified in the "Color"
section in the ffmpeg-utils manual), a position (specified as I<X>/I<Y>, where
I<X> and I<Y> are floating point numbers) and/or a string.

The number and types of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an
effect parameter is not specified, the default value is set.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Apply the distort0r effect, setting the first two double parameters:
	
	frei0r=filter_name=distort0r:filter_params=0.5|0.01



=item *

Apply the colordistance effect, taking a color as the first parameter:
	
	frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
	frei0r=colordistance:violet
	frei0r=colordistance:0x112233



=item *

Apply the perspective effect, specifying the top left and top right image
positions:
	
	frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2|0.8/0.2


=back


For more information, see
E<lt>B<http://frei0r.dyne.org>E<gt>


=head2 geq


The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<lum_expr, lum>

Set the luminance expression.

=item B<cb_expr, cb>

Set the chrominance blue expression.

=item B<cr_expr, cr>

Set the chrominance red expression.

=item B<alpha_expr, a>

Set the alpha expression.

=item B<red_expr, r>

Set the red expression.

=item B<green_expr, g>

Set the green expression.

=item B<blue_expr, b>

Set the blue expression.

=back


The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one
of the B<lum_expr>, B<cb_expr>, or B<cr_expr>
options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr
colorspace. If one of the B<red_expr>, B<green_expr>, or
B<blue_expr> options is specified, it will select an RGB
colorspace.

If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the other
one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque value.
If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate
to the luminance expression.

The expressions can use the following variables and functions:


=over 4


=item B<N>

The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from C<0>.


=item B<X>


=item B<Y>

The coordinates of the current sample.


=item B<W>


=item B<H>

The width and height of the image.


=item B<SW>


=item B<SH>

Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered plane. It is the
ratio between the corresponding luma plane number of pixels and the current
plane ones. E.g. for YUV4:2:0 the values are C<1,1> for the luma plane, and
C<0.5,0.5> for chroma planes.


=item B<T>

Time of the current frame, expressed in seconds.


=item B<p(x, y)>

Return the value of the pixel at location (I<x>,I<y>) of the current
plane.


=item B<lum(x, y)>

Return the value of the pixel at location (I<x>,I<y>) of the luminance
plane.


=item B<cb(x, y)>

Return the value of the pixel at location (I<x>,I<y>) of the
blue-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.


=item B<cr(x, y)>

Return the value of the pixel at location (I<x>,I<y>) of the
red-difference chroma plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.


=item B<r(x, y)>


=item B<g(x, y)>


=item B<b(x, y)>

Return the value of the pixel at location (I<x>,I<y>) of the
red/green/blue component. Return 0 if there is no such component.


=item B<alpha(x, y)>

Return the value of the pixel at location (I<x>,I<y>) of the alpha
plane. Return 0 if there is no such plane.

=back


For functions, if I<x> and I<y> are outside the area, the value will be
automatically clipped to the closer edge.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Flip the image horizontally:
	
	geq=p(W-X\,Y)



=item *

Generate a bidimensional sine wave, with angle C<PI/3> and a
wavelength of 100 pixels:
	
	geq=128 + 100*sin(2*(PI/100)*(cos(PI/3)*(X-50*T) + sin(PI/3)*Y)):128:128



=item *

Generate a fancy enigmatic moving light:
	
	nullsrc=s=256x256,geq=random(1)/hypot(X-cos(N*0.07)*W/2-W/2\,Y-sin(N*0.09)*H/2-H/2)^2*1000000*sin(N*0.02):128:128



=item *

Generate a quick emboss effect:
	
	format=gray,geq=lum_expr='(p(X,Y)+(256-p(X-4,Y-4)))/2'



=item *

Modify RGB components depending on pixel position:
	
	geq=r='X/W*r(X,Y)':g='(1-X/W)*g(X,Y)':b='(H-Y)/H*b(X,Y)'


=back



=head2 gradfun


Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly flat
regions by truncation to 8bit color depth.
Interpolate the gradients that should go where the bands are, and
dither them.

It is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to
lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and
bring back the bands.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<strength>

The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also
the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from
.51 to 64; the default value is 1.2. Out-of-range values will be clipped to the
valid range.


=item B<radius>

The neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius makes for smoother
gradients, but also prevents the filter from modifying the pixels near detailed
regions. Acceptable values are 8-32; the default value is 16. Out-of-range
values will be clipped to the valid range.


=back


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:
I<strength>[:I<radius>]


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Apply the filter with a C<3.5> strength and radius of C<8>:
	
	gradfun=3.5:8



=item *

Specify radius, omitting the strength (which will fall-back to the default
value):
	
	gradfun=radius=8



=back




=head2 haldclut


Apply a Hald CLUT to a video stream.

First input is the video stream to process, and second one is the Hald CLUT.
The Hald CLUT input can be a simple picture or a complete video stream.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<shortest>

Force termination when the shortest input terminates. Default is C<0>.

=item B<repeatlast>

Continue applying the last CLUT after the end of the stream. A value of
C<0> disable the filter after the last frame of the CLUT is reached.
Default is C<1>.

=back


C<haldclut> also has the same interpolation options as B<lut3d> (both
filters share the same internals).

More information about the Hald CLUT can be found on Eskil Steenberg's website
(Hald CLUT author) at E<lt>B<http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html>E<gt>.


=head3 Workflow examples



=head4 Hald CLUT video stream


Generate an identity Hald CLUT stream altered with various effects:
	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B<haldclutsrc>=8 -vf "hue=H=2*PI*t:s=sin(2*PI*t)+1, curves=cross_process" -t 10 -c:v ffv1 clut.nut


Note: make sure you use a lossless codec.

Then use it with C<haldclut> to apply it on some random stream:
	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i mandelbrot -i clut.nut -filter_complex '[0][1] haldclut' -t 20 mandelclut.mkv


The Hald CLUT will be applied to the 10 first seconds (duration of
F<clut.nut>), then the latest picture of that CLUT stream will be applied
to the remaining frames of the C<mandelbrot> stream.


=head4 Hald CLUT with preview


A Hald CLUT is supposed to be a squared image of C<Level*Level*Level> by
C<Level*Level*Level> pixels. For a given Hald CLUT, FFmpeg will select the
biggest possible square starting at the top left of the picture. The remaining
padding pixels (bottom or right) will be ignored. This area can be used to add
a preview of the Hald CLUT.

Typically, the following generated Hald CLUT will be supported by the
C<haldclut> filter:

	
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -i B<haldclutsrc>=8 -vf "
	   pad=iw+320 [padded_clut];
	   smptebars=s=320x256, split [a][b];
	   [padded_clut][a] overlay=W-320:h, curves=color_negative [main];
	   [main][b] overlay=W-320" -frames:v 1 clut.png


It contains the original and a preview of the effect of the CLUT: SMPTE color
bars are displayed on the right-top, and below the same color bars processed by
the color changes.

Then, the effect of this Hald CLUT can be visualized with:
	
	ffplay input.mkv -vf "movie=clut.png, [in] haldclut"



=head2 hflip


Flip the input video horizontally.

For example, to horizontally flip the input video with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "hflip" out.avi



=head2 histeq

This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.

It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast filter". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<strength>

Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.


=item B<intensity>

Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.


=item B<antibanding>

Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are C<none>, C<weak> or
C<strong>. It defaults to C<none>.

=back



=head2 histogram


Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.

The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode>

Set histogram mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<levels>

Standard histogram that displays the color components distribution in an
image. Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.


=item B<color>

Displays chroma values (U/V color placement) in a two dimensional
graph (which is called a vectorscope). The brighter a pixel in the
vectorscope, the more pixels of the input frame correspond to that pixel
(i.e., more pixels have this chroma value). The V component is displayed on
the horizontal (X) axis, with the leftmost side being V = 0 and the rightmost
side being V = 255. The U component is displayed on the vertical (Y) axis,
with the top representing U = 0 and the bottom representing U = 255.

The position of a white pixel in the graph corresponds to the chroma value of
a pixel of the input clip. The graph can therefore be used to read the hue
(color flavor) and the saturation (the dominance of the hue in the color). As
the hue of a color changes, it moves around the square. At the center of the
square the saturation is zero, which means that the corresponding pixel has no
color. If the amount of a specific color is increased (while leaving the other
colors unchanged) the saturation increases, and the indicator moves towards
the edge of the square.


=item B<color2>

Chroma values in vectorscope, similar as C<color> but actual chroma values
are displayed.


=item B<waveform>

Per row/column color component graph. In row mode, the graph on the left side
represents color component value 0 and the right side represents value = 255.
In column mode, the top side represents color component value = 0 and bottom
side represents value = 255.

=back

Default value is C<levels>.


=item B<level_height>

Set height of level in C<levels>. Default value is C<200>.
Allowed range is [50, 2048].


=item B<scale_height>

Set height of color scale in C<levels>. Default value is C<12>.
Allowed range is [0, 40].


=item B<step>

Set step for C<waveform> mode. Smaller values are useful to find out how
many values of the same luminance are distributed across input rows/columns.
Default value is C<10>. Allowed range is [1, 255].


=item B<waveform_mode>

Set mode for C<waveform>. Can be either C<row>, or C<column>.
Default is C<row>.


=item B<waveform_mirror>

Set mirroring mode for C<waveform>. C<0> means unmirrored, C<1>
means mirrored. In mirrored mode, higher values will be represented on the left
side for C<row> mode and at the top for C<column> mode. Default is
C<0> (unmirrored).


=item B<display_mode>

Set display mode for C<waveform> and C<levels>.
It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<parade>

Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
C<row> waveform mode or one below the other in C<column> waveform mode
for C<waveform> histogram mode. For C<levels> histogram mode,
per color component graphs are placed below each other.

Using this display mode in C<waveform> histogram mode makes it easy to
spot color casts in the highlights and shadows of an image, by comparing the
contours of the top and the bottom graphs of each waveform. Since whites,
grays, and blacks are characterized by exactly equal amounts of red, green,
and blue, neutral areas of the picture should display three waveforms of
roughly equal width/height. If not, the correction is easy to perform by
making level adjustments the three waveforms.


=item B<overlay>

Presents information identical to that in the C<parade>, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

This display mode in C<waveform> histogram mode makes it easier to spot
relative differences or similarities in overlapping areas of the color
components that are supposed to be identical, such as neutral whites, grays,
or blacks.

=back

Default is C<parade>.


=item B<levels_mode>

Set mode for C<levels>. Can be either C<linear>, or C<logarithmic>.
Default is C<linear>.

=head2 lenscorrection


Correct radial lens distortion

This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.

Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the KDE project.

In contrast to the B<vignette> filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas B<vignette> corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.


=head3 Options


The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<cx>

Relative x-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distrortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
width.

=item B<cy>

Relative y-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distrortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
height.

=item B<k1>

Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. 0.5 means no correction.

=item B<k2>

Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term. 0.5 means no correction.

=back


The formula that generates the correction is:

I<r_src> = I<r_tgt> * (1 + I<k1> * (I<r_tgt> / I<r_0>)^2 + I<k2> * (I<r_tgt> / I<r_0>)^4)

where I<r_0> is halve of the image diagonal and I<r_src> and I<r_tgt> are the
distances from the focal point in the source and target images, respectively.

=head2 lut, lutrgb, lutyuv


Compute a look-up table for binding each pixel component input value
to an output value, and apply it to the input video.

I<lutyuv> applies a lookup table to a YUV input video, I<lutrgb>
to an RGB input video.

These filters accept the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<c0>

set first pixel component expression

=item B<c1>

set second pixel component expression

=item B<c2>

set third pixel component expression

=item B<c3>

set fourth pixel component expression, corresponds to the alpha component


=item B<r>

=item B<a>

alpha component expression


=item B<y>

set Y/luminance component expression

=item B<u>

set U/Cb component expression

=item B<v>

set V/Cr component expression

=back


Each of them specifies the expression to use for computing the lookup table for
the corresponding pixel component values.

The exact component associated to each of the I<c*> options depends on the
format in input.

The I<lut> filter requires either YUV or RGB pixel formats in input,
I<lutrgb> requires RGB pixel formats in input, and I<lutyuv> requires YUV.

The expressions can contain the following constants and functions:


=over 4


=item B<w>

I<minval>-I<maxval> range; it corresponds to the expression
"maxval-clipval+minval".


=item B<clip(val)>

I<minval>-I<maxval> range.


=item B<gammaval(gamma)>

clipped to the I<minval>-I<maxval> range. It corresponds to the
expression
"pow((clipval-minval)/(maxval-minval)\,I<gamma>)*(maxval-minval)+minval"

=head2 mp


Apply an MPlayer filter to the input video.

This filter provides a wrapper around some of the filters of
MPlayer/MEncoder.

This wrapper is considered experimental. Some of the wrapped filters
may not work properly and we may drop support for them, as they will
be implemented natively into FFmpeg. Thus you should avoid
depending on them when writing portable scripts.

The filter accepts the parameters:
I<filter_name>[:=]I<filter_params>

I<filter_name> is the name of a supported MPlayer filter,
I<filter_params> is a string containing the parameters accepted by
the named filter.

The list of the currently supported filters follows:

=over 4


=item I<eq2>


=item I<eq>


=item I<fspp>


=item I<ilpack>


=item I<pp7>


=item I<softpulldown>

=head2 mpdecimate


Drop frames that do not differ greatly from the previous frame in
order to reduce frame rate.

The main use of this filter is for very-low-bitrate encoding
(e.g. streaming over dialup modem), but it could in theory be used for
fixing movies that were inverse-telecined incorrectly.

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<max>

Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped (if
positive), or the minimum interval between dropped frames (if
negative). If the value is 0, the frame is dropped unregarding the
number of previous sequentially dropped frames.

Default value is 0.


=item B<hi>


=item B<lo>


=item B<frac>

Set the dropping threshold values.

Values for B<hi> and B<lo> are for 8x8 pixel blocks and
represent actual pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64
corresponds to 1 unit of difference for each pixel, or the same spread
out differently over the block.

A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
than a threshold of B<hi>, and if no more than B<frac> blocks (1
meaning the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of B<lo>.

Default value for B<hi> is 64*12, default value for B<lo> is
64*5, and default value for B<frac> is 0.33.

Available values for component flags are:

=over 4


=item B<a>

averaged temporal noise (smoother)

=item B<p>

mix random noise with a (semi)regular pattern

=item B<t>

=back


=back



=head3 Examples


Add temporal and uniform noise to input video:
	
	noise=alls=20:allf=t+u



=head2 null


Pass the video source unchanged to the output.


=head2 ocv


Apply a video transform using libopencv.

To enable this filter, install the libopencv library and headers and
configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-libopencv>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<filter_name>

The name of the libopencv filter to apply.


=item B<filter_params>

The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not specified, the default
values are assumed.


=back


Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
information:
E<lt>B<http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/c/image_filtering.html>E<gt>

Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.



=head3 dilate


Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function C<cvDilate>.

It accepts the parameters: I<struct_el>|I<nb_iterations>.

I<struct_el> represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
I<cols>xI<rows>+I<anchor_x>xI<anchor_y>/I<shape>

I<cols> and I<rows> represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, I<anchor_x> and I<anchor_y> the anchor
point, and I<shape> the shape for the structuring element. I<shape>
must be "rect", "cross", "ellipse", or "custom".

If the value for I<shape> is "custom", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=I<filename>". The file with name
I<filename> is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
I<shape> is used, I<cols> and I<rows> are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.

The default value for I<struct_el> is "3x3+0x0/rect".

I<nb_iterations> specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.

Some examples:
	
	# Use the default values
	ocv=dilate
	
	# Dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterating two times
	ocv=filter_name=dilate:filter_params=5x5+2x2/cross|2
	
	# Read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterating two times.
	# The file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this
	#   *
	#  ***
	# *****
	#  ***
	#   *
	# The specified columns and rows are ignored
	# but the anchor point coordinates are not
	ocv=dilate:0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape|2



=head3 erode


Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function C<cvErode>.

It accepts the parameters: I<struct_el>:I<nb_iterations>,
with the same syntax and semantics as the B<dilate> filter.


=head3 smooth


Smooth the input video.

The filter takes the following parameters:
I<type>|I<param1>|I<param2>|I<param3>|I<param4>.

I<type> is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: "blur", "blur_no_scale", "median", "gaussian",
or "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".

The meaning of I<param1>, I<param2>, I<param3>, and I<param4>
depend on the smooth type. I<param1> and
I<param2> accept integer positive values or 0. I<param3> and
I<param4> accept floating point values.

The default value for I<param1> is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.

These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the
libopencv function C<cvSmooth>.



=head2 overlay


Overlay one video on top of another.

It takes two inputs and has one output. The first input is the "main"
video on which the second input is overlayed.

It accepts the following parameters:

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Set the expression for the x and y coordinates of the overlayed video
on the main video. Default value is "0" for both expressions. In case
the expression is invalid, it is set to a huge value (meaning that the
overlay will not be displayed within the output visible area).


=item B<eof_action>

The action to take when EOF is encountered on the secondary input; it accepts
one of the following values:


=over 4


=item B<repeat>

Repeat the last frame (the default).

=item B<endall>

End both streams.

=item B<pass>

Pass the main input through.

=back



=item B<eval>

Set when the expressions for B<x>, and B<y> are evaluated.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<init>

only evaluate expressions once during the filter initialization or
when a command is processed


=item B<frame>

evaluate expressions for each incoming frame

=back


Default value is B<frame>.


=item B<shortest>

If set to 1, force the output to terminate when the shortest input
terminates. Default value is 0.


=item B<format>

Set the format for the output video.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<yuv420>

force YUV420 output


=item B<yuv422>

force YUV422 output


=item B<yuv444>

force YUV444 output


=item B<rgb>

force RGB output

=back


Default value is B<yuv420>.


=item B<rgb> I<(deprecated)>

If set to 1, force the filter to accept inputs in the RGB
color space. Default value is 0. This option is deprecated, use
B<format> instead.


=item B<repeatlast>

If set to 1, force the filter to draw the last overlay frame over the
main input until the end of the stream. A value of 0 disables this
behavior. Default value is 1.

=back


The B<x>, and B<y> expressions can contain the following
parameters.


=over 4


=item B<main_w, W>


=item B<main_h, H>

The main input width and height.


=item B<overlay_w, w>


=item B<overlay_h, h>

The overlay input width and height.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

The computed values for I<x> and I<y>. They are evaluated for
each new frame.


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values of the output
format. For example for the pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and
I<vsub> is 1.


=item B<n>

the number of input frame, starting from 0


=item B<pos>

the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown


=item B<t>

The timestamp, expressed in seconds. It's NAN if the input timestamp is unknown.


=back


Note that the I<n>, I<pos>, I<t> variables are available only
when evaluation is done I<per frame>, and will evaluate to NAN
when B<eval> is set to B<init>.

Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a I<setpts=PTS-STARTPTS> filter to
have them begin in the same zero timestamp, as the example for
the I<movie> filter does.

You can chain together more overlays but you should test the
efficiency of such approach.


=head3 Commands


This filter supports the following commands:

=over 4


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Modify the x and y of the overlay input.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

provided I<x>, I<y> coordinates.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Specify an expression for the size of the output image with the
paddings added. If the value for I<width> or I<height> is 0, the
corresponding input size is used for the output.

The I<width> expression can reference the value set by the
I<height> expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<width> and I<height> is 0.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

Specify the offsets to place the input image at within the padded area,
with respect to the top/left border of the output image.

The I<x> expression can reference the value set by the I<y>
expression, and vice versa.

The default value of I<x> and I<y> is 0.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the padded area. For the syntax of this option,
check the "Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.

The default value of I<color> is "black".

=back


The value for the I<width>, I<height>, I<x>, and I<y>
options are expressions containing the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<in_w>


=item B<in_h>

The input video width and height.


=item B<iw>


=item B<ih>

These are the same as I<in_w> and I<in_h>.


=item B<out_w>


=item B<out_h>

The output width and height (the size of the padded area), as
specified by the I<width> and I<height> expressions.


=item B<ow>


=item B<oh>

These are the same as I<out_w> and I<out_h>.


=item B<x>


=item B<y>

expressions, or NAN if not yet specified.


=item B<a>

same as I<iw> / I<ih>

input sample aspect ratio


=item B<dar>

input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (I<iw> / I<ih>) * I<sar>


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

The horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Add paddings with the color "violet" to the input video. The output video
size is 640x480, and the top-left corner of the input video is placed at
column 0, row 40
	
	pad=640:480:0:40:violet


The example above is equivalent to the following command:
	
	pad=width=640:height=480:x=0:y=40:color=violet



=item *

Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2,
and put the input video at the center of the padded area:
	
	pad="3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the maximum
value between the input width and height, and put the input video at
the center of the padded area:
	
	pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:
	
	pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display aspect
correctly, it is necessary to use I<sar> in the expression,
according to the relation:
	
	(ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
	X = output_dar / sar


Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:
	
	pad="ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"



=item *

Double the output size and put the input video in the bottom-right
corner of the output padded area:
	
	pad="2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih"

=item B<a>

Capture field order determined automatically by field flags, transfer
opposite.
Filter selects among B<t> and B<b> modes on a frame by frame
basis using field flags. If no field information is available,
then this works just like B<u>.

=head2 psnr


Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio) between two input videos.

This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the PSNR.

Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.

The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.

The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each
frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames
equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:

	
	PSNR = 10*log10(MAX^2/MSE)


Where MAX is the average of the maximum values of each component of the
image.

The description of the accepted parameters follows.


=over 4


=item B<stats_file, f>

If specified the filter will use the named file to save the PSNR of
each individual frame.

=back


The file printed if I<stats_file> is selected, contains a sequence of
key/value pairs of the form I<key>:I<value> for each compared
couple of frames.

A description of each shown parameter follows:


=over 4


=item B<n>

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 1


=item B<mse_avg>

Mean Square Error pixel-by-pixel average difference of the compared
frames, averaged over all the image components.

frames for the component specified by the suffix.


=item B<psnr_y, psnr_u, psnr_v, psnr_r, psnr_g, psnr_b, psnr_a>

Peak Signal to Noise ratio of the compared frames for the component
specified by the suffix.

=back


For example:
	
	movie=ref_movie.mpg, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
	[main][ref] psnr="stats_file=stats.log" [out]


On this example the input file being processed is compared with the
reference file F<ref_movie.mpg>. The PSNR of each individual frame
is stored in F<stats.log>.



=head2 pullup


Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
content.

The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.

To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use C<fps=24000/1001> if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,
C<fps=24> for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<jl>


=item B<jr>


=item B<jt>


=item B<jb>

These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and
bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels,
while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.


=item B<sb>

Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to -1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.
Default value is C<0>.


=item B<mp>

Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<l>

Use luma plane.


=item B<u>

Use chroma blue plane.


=item B<v>

Use chroma red plane.

=back


This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter's computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
The main purpose of setting B<mp> to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU
load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.

=back


For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is
necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse
telecine NTSC input:
	
	ffmpeg -i input -vf pullup -r 24000/1001 ...



=head2 removelogo


Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which
pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.

=back


Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.

If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.


=head2 rotate


Rotate video by an arbitrary angle expressed in radians.

The filter accepts the following options:

A description of the optional parameters follows.

=over 4


=item B<angle, a>

Set an expression for the angle by which to rotate the input video
clockwise, expressed as a number of radians. A negative value will
result in a counter-clockwise rotation. By default it is set to "0".

This expression is evaluated for each frame.


=item B<out_w, ow>

Set the output width expression, default value is "iw".
This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.


=item B<out_h, oh>

Set the output height expression, default value is "ih".
This expression is evaluated just once during configuration.


=item B<bilinear>

Enable bilinear interpolation if set to 1, a value of 0 disables
it. Default value is 1.


=item B<fillcolor, c>

Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by the rotated
image. For the generalsyntax of this option, check the "Color" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual. If the special value "none" is selected then no
background is printed (useful for example if the background is never shown).

Default value is "black".

=back


The expressions for the angle and the output size can contain the
following constants and functions:


=over 4


=item B<n>

sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0. It is always NAN
before the first frame is filtered.


=item B<t>

time in seconds of the input frame, it is set to 0 when the filter is
configured. It is always NAN before the first frame is filtered.


=item B<hsub>


=item B<vsub>

horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for the
pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.


=item B<in_w, iw>

the input video width and height


=item B<out_w, ow>


=item B<out_h, oh>

specified by the I<width> and I<height> expressions


=item B<rotw(a)>


=item B<roth(a)>

the minimal width/height required for completely containing the input
video rotated by I<a> radians.

These are only available when computing the B<out_w> and
B<out_h> expressions.

=back



=head3 Examples

The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.

If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.

=back



=head2 sab


Apply Shape Adaptive Blur.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<luma_radius, lr>

Set luma blur filter strength, must be a value in range 0.1-4.0, default
value is 1.0. A greater value will result in a more blurred image, and
in slower processing.

be a value in the 0.1-100.0 range, default value is 1.0.


=item B<chroma_radius, cr>

Set chroma blur filter strength, must be a value in range 0.1-4.0. A
greater value will result in a more blurred image, and in slower
processing.

=back


Each chroma option value, if not explicitly specified, is set to the
corresponding luma option value.



=head2 scale


Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

If the input image format is different from the format requested by
the next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the
requested format.


=head3 Options

The filter accepts the following options, or any of the options
supported by the libswscale scaler.

See B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for
the complete list of scaler options.


=over 4


=item B<width, w>


=item B<height, h>

Set the output video dimension expression. Default value is the input
dimension.

If the value is 0, the input width is used for the output.

If one of the values is -1, the scale filter will use a value that
maintains the aspect ratio of the input image, calculated from the
other specified dimension. If both of them are -1, the input size is
used

If one of the values is -n with n E<gt> 1, the scale filter will also use a value
that maintains the aspect ratio of the input image, calculated from the other
specified dimension. After that it will, however, make sure that the calculated
dimension is divisible by n and adjust the value if necessary.

See below for the list of accepted constants for use in the dimension
expression.


=item B<interl>

Set the interlacing mode. It accepts the following values:


=over 4


=item B<1>

Force interlaced aware scaling.


=item B<0>

Do not apply interlaced scaling.


=item B<-1>

Select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source frames
are flagged as interlaced or not.

=back


Default value is B<0>.


=item B<flags>

Set libswscale scaling flags. See
B<the ffmpeg-scaler manual> for the
complete list of values. If not explicitly specified the filter applies
the default flags.

section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.


=item B<in_color_matrix>


=item B<out_color_matrix>

Set in/output YCbCr color space type.

This allows the autodetected value to be overridden as well as allows forcing

keep the original aspect ratio. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<disable>

Scale the video as specified and disable this feature.


=item B<decrease>

The output video dimensions will automatically be decreased if needed.


=item B<increase>

The output video dimensions will automatically be increased if needed.


=back


One useful instance of this option is that when you know a specific device's
maximum allowed resolution, you can use this to limit the output video to
that, while retaining the aspect ratio. For example, device A allows
1280x720 playback, and your video is 1920x800. Using this option (set it to
decrease) and specifying 1280x720 to the command line makes the output
1280x533.

Please note that this is a different thing than specifying -1 for B<w>
or B<h>, you still need to specify the output resolution for this option
to work.


=back


The values of the B<w> and B<h> options are expressions
containing the following constants:


=over 4

	scale=qcif


which can also be written as:
	
	scale=size=qcif

=back



=head2 separatefields


The C<separatefields> takes a frame-based video input and splits
each frame into its components fields, producing a new half height clip
with twice the frame rate and twice the frame count.

This filter use field-dominance information in frame to decide which
of each pair of fields to place first in the output.
If it gets it wrong use B<setfield> filter before C<separatefields> filter.


=head2 setdar, setsar


The C<setdar> filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter
output video.

This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect
Ratio, according to the following equation:
	
	<DAR> = <HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION> / <VERTICAL_RESOLUTION> * <SAR>


Keep in mind that the C<setdar> filter does not modify the pixel
dimensions of the video frame. Also, the display aspect ratio set by
this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain,
e.g. in case of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is
applied.

The C<setsar> filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for
the filter output video.

Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the
output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation
above.

Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the C<setsar>
filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if
another "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<r, ratio, dar (C<setdar> only), sar (C<setsar> only)>

Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

The parameter can be a floating point number string, an expression, or
a string of the form I<num>:I<den>, where I<num> and
I<den> are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. If
the parameter is not specified, it is assumed the value "0".
In case the form "I<num>:I<den>" is used, the C<:> character
should be escaped.


=item B<max>

Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and
denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational.
Default value is C<100>.


=back


The parameter I<sar> is an expression containing
the following constants:


=over 4


=item B<E, PI, PHI>

These are approximated values for the mathematical constants e
(Euler's number), pi (Greek pi), and phi (the golden ratio).


=item B<w, h>

The input width and height.


=item B<a>

These are the same as I<w> / I<h>.


=item B<sar>

The input sample aspect ratio.


=item B<dar>

The input display aspect ratio. It is the same as
(I<w> / I<h>) * I<sar>.


=item B<hsub, vsub>

Horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example, for the
pixel format "yuv422p" I<hsub> is 2 and I<vsub> is 1.

=back



=head3 Examples

	setdar=dar=1.77777



=item *

To change the sample aspect ratio to 10:11, specify:
	
	setsar=sar=10/11



=item *

To set a display aspect ratio of 16:9, and specify a maximum integer value of
1000 in the aspect ratio reduction, use the command:
	
	setdar=ratio=16/9:max=1000



=back




=head2 setfield


Force field for the output video frame.

The C<setfield> filter marks the interlace type field for the
output frames. It does not change the input frame, but only sets the
corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by
following filters (e.g. C<fieldorder> or C<yadif>).

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<mode>

Available values are:

=head2 smartblur


Blur the input video without impacting the outlines.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<luma_radius, lr>

Set the luma radius. The option value must be a float number in
the range [0.1,5.0] that specifies the variance of the gaussian filter
used to blur the image (slower if larger). Default value is 1.0.


=item B<luma_strength, ls>

Set the luma strength. The option value must be a float number
in the range [-1.0,1.0] that configures the blurring. A value included
in [0.0,1.0] will blur the image whereas a value included in
[-1.0,0.0] will sharpen the image. Default value is 1.0.


=item B<luma_threshold, lt>

Set the luma threshold used as a coefficient to determine
whether a pixel should be blurred or not. The option value must be an
integer in the range [-30,30]. A value of 0 will filter all the image,
a value included in [0,30] will filter flat areas and a value included
in [-30,0] will filter edges. Default value is 0.


=item B<chroma_radius, cr>

Set the chroma radius. The option value must be a float number in
the range [0.1,5.0] that specifies the variance of the gaussian filter
used to blur the image (slower if larger). Default value is 1.0.


=item B<chroma_strength, cs>

Set the chroma strength. The option value must be a float number
in the range [-1.0,1.0] that configures the blurring. A value included
in [0.0,1.0] will blur the image whereas a value included in
[-1.0,0.0] will sharpen the image. Default value is 1.0.


=item B<chroma_threshold, ct>

Set the chroma threshold used as a coefficient to determine
whether a pixel should be blurred or not. The option value must be an
integer in the range [-30,30]. A value of 0 will filter all the image,
a value included in [0,30] will filter flat areas and a value included
in [-30,0] will filter edges. Default value is 0.

=head2 spp


Apply a simple postprocessing filter that compresses and decompresses the image
at several (or - in the case of B<quality> level C<6> - all) shifts
and average the results.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<quality>

Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 0-6. If set to C<0>, the filter will have no
effect. A value of C<6> means the higher quality. For each increment of
that value the speed drops by a factor of approximately 2.  Default value is
C<3>.


=item B<qp>

Force a constant quantization parameter. If not set, the filter will use the QP
from the video stream (if available).


=item B<mode>

Set thresholding mode. Available modes are:


=over 4


=item B<hard>

Set hard thresholding (default).

=item B<soft>

Set soft thresholding (better de-ringing effect, but likely blurrier).

=back



=item B<use_bframe_qp>

Enable the use of the QP from the B-Frames if set to C<1>. Using this
option may cause flicker since the B-Frames have often larger QP. Default is
C<0> (not enabled).

=back




=head2 subtitles


Draw subtitles on top of input video using the libass library.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-libass>. This filter also requires a build with libavcodec and
libavformat to convert the passed subtitles file to ASS (Advanced Substation
Alpha) subtitles format.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the filename of the subtitle file to read. It must be specified.


=item B<original_size>

Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS file
was composed. For the syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in
the ffmpeg-utils manual. Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio arithmetic,
this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the aspect ratio has been
changed.


=item B<charenc>

Set subtitles input character encoding. C<subtitles> filter only. Only
useful if not UTF-8.


=item B<stream_index, si>

Set subtitles stream index. C<subtitles> filter only.

=back


If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value
specifies the B<filename>.

For example, to render the file F<sub.srt> on top of the input
video, use the command:
	
	subtitles=sub.srt


which is equivalent to:
	
	subtitles=filename=sub.srt


To render the default subtitles stream from file F<video.mkv>, use:
	
	subtitles=video.mkv


To render the second subtitles stream from that file, use:
	
	subtitles=video.mkv:si=1



=head2 super2xsai


Scale the input by 2x and smooth using the Super2xSaI (Scale and
Interpolate) pixel art scaling algorithm.

Useful for enlarging pixel art images without reducing sharpness.


=head2 swapuv

Swap U & V plane.


=head2 telecine


Apply telecine process to the video.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<first_field>


=over 4


=item B<top, t>

top field first

=item B<bottom, b>

bottom field first
The default value is C<top>.

=back



=item B<pattern>

A string of numbers representing the pulldown pattern you wish to apply.
The default value is C<23>.

=back


	
	Some typical patterns:
	
	NTSC output (30i):
	27.5p: 32222
	24p: 23 (classic)
	24p: 2332 (preferred)
	20p: 33
	18p: 334
	16p: 3444
	
	PAL output (25i):
	27.5p: 12222
	24p: 222222222223 ("Euro pulldown")
	16.67p: 33
	16p: 33333334



=head2 thumbnail

Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive frames.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<n>

Set the frames batch size to analyze; in a set of I<n> frames, the filter
will pick one of them, and then handle the next batch of I<n> frames until
the end. Default is C<100>.

=back


Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger I<n>
value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not recommended.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Extract one picture each 50 frames:
	
	thumbnail=50



=item *

Complete example of a thumbnail creation with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png


=back



=head2 tile


Tile several successive frames together.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<layout>

Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns). For the syntax of
this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.


=item B<nb_frames>

Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It must be less
than or equal to I<w>xI<h>. The default value is C<0>, meaning all
the area will be used.


=item B<margin>

Set the outer border margin in pixels.


=item B<padding>

Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between frames). For
more advanced padding options (such as having different values for the edges),
refer to the pad video filter.


=item B<color>

Specify the color of the unused areaFor the syntax of this option, check the
"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value of I<color>
is "black".

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Produce 8x8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (B<-skip_frame nokey>) in a movie:
	
	ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf 'scale=128:72,tile=8x8' -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png

The B<-vsync 0> is necessary to prevent B<ffmpeg> from
duplicating each output frame to accommodate the originally detected frame
rate.


=item *

Display C<5> pictures in an area of C<3x2> frames,
with C<7> pixels between them, and C<2> pixels of initial margin, using
mixed flat and named options:
	
	tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2


=back



=head2 tinterlace


Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is
considered odd.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<mode>

Specify the mode of the interlacing. This option can also be specified
as a value alone. See below for a list of values for this option.

Available values are:


=over 4


=item B<merge, 0>

Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field,
generating a double height frame at half frame rate.


=item B<drop_odd, 1>

Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped, generating a frame with
unchanged height at half frame rate.


=item B<drop_even, 2>

Only output odd frames, even frames are dropped, generating a frame with
unchanged height at half frame rate.


=item B<pad, 3>

Expand each frame to full height, but pad alternate lines with black,
generating a frame with double height at the same input frame rate.


=item B<interleave_top, 4>

Interleave the upper field from odd frames with the lower field from
even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half frame rate.


=item B<interleave_bottom, 5>

Interleave the lower field from odd frames with the upper field from
even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half frame rate.


=item B<interlacex2, 6>

Double frame rate with unchanged height. Frames are inserted each
containing the second temporal field from the previous input frame and
the first temporal field from the next input frame. This mode relies on
the top_field_first flag. Useful for interlaced video displays with no
field synchronisation.

=back


Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward
compatibility reasons.

Default mode is C<merge>.


=item B<flags>

Specify flags influencing the filter process.

Available value for I<flags> is:


=over 4


=item B<low_pass_filter, vlfp>

Enable vertical low-pass filtering in the filter.
Vertical low-pass filtering is required when creating an interlaced
destination from a progressive source which contains high-frequency
vertical detail. Filtering will reduce interlace 'twitter' and Moire
patterning.

Vertical low-pass filtering can only be enabled for B<mode>
I<interleave_top> and I<interleave_bottom>.


=back


=back



=head2 transpose


Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<dir>

Specify the transposition direction.

Can assume the following values:

=over 4


=item B<0, 4, cclock_flip>

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip (default), that is:
	
	L.R     L.l
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     R.r



=item B<1, 5, clock>

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, that is:
	
	L.R     l.L
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     r.R



=item B<2, 6, cclock>

Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:
	
	L.R     R.r
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     L.l



=item B<3, 7, clock_flip>

Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:
	
	L.R     r.R
	. . ->  . .
	l.r     l.L


=back


For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input
video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are
deprecated, the C<passthrough> option should be used instead.

Numerical values are deprecated, and should be dropped in favor of
symbolic constants.


=item B<passthrough>

Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the one
specified by the specified value. It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Always apply transposition.

=item B<portrait>

Preserve portrait geometry (when I<height> E<gt>= I<width>).

=item B<landscape>

Preserve landscape geometry (when I<width> E<gt>= I<height>).

=back


Default value is C<none>.

=back


For example to rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and preserve portrait
layout:
	
	transpose=dir=1:passthrough=portrait


The command above can also be specified as:
	
	transpose=1:portrait



=head2 trim

Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.

It accepts the following parameters:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the
timestamp I<start> will be the first frame in the output.


=item B<end>

Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame
immediately preceding the one with the timestamp I<end> will be the last
frame in the output.


=item B<start_pts>

This is the same as I<start>, except this option sets the start timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.


=item B<end_pts>

This is the same as I<end>, except this option sets the end timestamp
in timebase units instead of seconds.


=item B<duration>

The maximum duration of the output in seconds.


=item B<start_frame>

The number of the first frame that should be passed to the output.


=item B<end_frame>

The number of the first frame that should be dropped.

=back


B<start>, B<end>, B<duration> are expressed as time
duration specifications, check the "Time duration" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual.

Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the B<duration>
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.

If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.

The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.

Examples:

=over 4


=item *

Drop everything except the second minute of input:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=60:120



=item *

Keep only the first second:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -vf trim=duration=1



=back

and 63. The default value is 5.


=item B<luma_amount, la>

Set the luma effect strength. It must be a floating point number, reasonable
values lay between -1.5 and 1.5.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Negative values will blur the input video, while positive values will
sharpen it, a value of zero will disable the effect.

Default value is 0.0.


=item B<opencl>

If set to 1, specify using OpenCL capabilities, only available if
FFmpeg was configured with C<--enable-opencl>. Default value is 0.


=back

=back




=head2 vidstabdetect


Analyze video stabilization/deshaking. Perform pass 1 of 2, see
B<vidstabtransform> for pass 2.

This filter generates a file with relative translation and rotation
transform information about subsequent frames, which is then used by
the B<vidstabtransform> filter.

To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
C<--enable-libvidstab>.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<result>

Set the path to the file used to write the transforms information.
Default value is F<transforms.trf>.


=item B<shakiness>

Set how shaky the video is and how quick the camera is. It accepts an
integer in the range 1-10, a value of 1 means little shakiness, a
value of 10 means strong shakiness. Default value is 5.


=item B<accuracy>

Set the accuracy of the detection process. It must be a value in the
range 1-15. A value of 1 means low accuracy, a value of 15 means high
accuracy. Default value is 15.


=item B<stepsize>

Set stepsize of the search process. The region around minimum is
scanned with 1 pixel resolution. Default value is 6.

discarded. Must be a floating point value in the range 0-1. Default
value is 0.3.


=item B<tripod>

Set reference frame number for tripod mode.

If enabled, the motion of the frames is compared to a reference frame
in the filtered stream, identified by the specified number. The idea
is to compensate all movements in a more-or-less static scene and keep
the camera view absolutely still.

If set to 0, it is disabled. The frames are counted starting from 1.


=item B<show>

Show fields and transforms in the resulting frames. It accepts an
integer in the range 0-2. Default value is 0, which disables any
visualization.

=back



=head3 Examples

=head2 vidstabtransform


Video stabilization/deshaking: pass 2 of 2,
see B<vidstabdetect> for pass 1.

Read a file with transform information for each frame and
apply/compensate them. Together with the B<vidstabdetect>
filter this can be used to deshake videos. See also
E<lt>B<http://public.hronopik.de/vid.stab>E<gt>. It is important to also use

camera movements. Default value is 10.

For example a number of 10 means that 21 frames are used (10 in the
past and 10 in the future) to smoothen the motion in the video. A
larger values leads to a smoother video, but limits the acceleration

=item B<relative>

Consider transforms as relative to previsou frame if set to 1,
absolute if set to 0. Default value is 0.


=item B<zoom>

Set percentage to zoom. A positive value will result in a zoom-in
effect, a negative value in a zoom-out effect. Default value is 0 (no
zoom).


=item B<optzoom>

Set optimal zooming to avoid borders.

Accepted values are:

=over 4


=item B<0>

disabled

=item B<1>

optimal static zoom value is determined (only very strong movements

=item B<2>

optimal adaptive zoom value is determined (no borders will be
visible), see B<zoomspeed>

=back


Note that the value given at zoom is added to the one calculated here.

Default value is B<init>.


=item B<dither>

Set dithering to reduce the circular banding effects. Default is C<1>
(enabled).


=item B<aspect>

Set vignette aspect. This setting allows one to adjust the shape of the vignette.

=head1 VIDEO SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available video sources.


=head2 buffer


Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in F<libavfilter/vsrc_buffer.h>.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4



=item B<video_size>

Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual.


=item B<width>

The input video width.


=item B<height>

The input video height.


=item B<pix_fmt>

A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.


=item B<time_base>

Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.


=item B<frame_rate>

Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.


=item B<pixel_aspect, sar>

The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.


=item B<sws_param>

Specify the optional parameters to be used for the scale filter which
is automatically inserted when an input change is detected in the
input size or format.

=back


For example:
	
	buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1


will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name "yuv410p" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in F<libavutil/pixfmt.h>),
this example corresponds to:
	
	buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1


Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this
syntax is deprecated:

I<width>:I<height>:I<pix_fmt>:I<time_base.num>:I<time_base.den>:I<pixel_aspect.num>:I<pixel_aspect.den>[:I<sws_param>]


=head2 cellauto


Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
B<filename>, and B<pattern> options. If such options are
not specified an initial state is created randomly.

At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of
the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole
frame is filled is defined by the B<scroll> option.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified file.
In the file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
file will be ignored.


=item B<pattern, p>

Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row, from
the specified string.

Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive
cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in the
string will be ignored.


=item B<rate, r>

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.


=item B<random_fill_ratio, ratio>

Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row. It
is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to
1/PHI.

This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.


=item B<random_seed, seed>

Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.


=item B<rule>

Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to 255.
Default value is 110.


=item B<size, s>

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check
the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.

If B<filename> or B<pattern> is specified, the size is set
by default to the width of the specified initial state row, and the
height is set to I<width> * PHI.

If B<size> is set, it must contain the width of the specified
pattern string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the
larger row.

If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value
defaults to "320x518" (used for a randomly generated initial state).


=item B<scroll>

If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the output
have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row will be
written over the top row just after the bottom row is filled.
Defaults to 1.


=item B<start_full, full>

If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before
outputting the first frame.
This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.


=item B<stitch>

If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges together.
This is the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

=back

=head2 life


Generate a life pattern.

This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.

The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The B<rule> option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.

This source accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<filename, f>

Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.

If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.


=item B<rate, r>

Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.


=item B<random_fill_ratio, ratio>

Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
It is ignored when a file is specified.


=item B<random_seed, seed>

Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.


=item B<rule>

Set the life rule.

A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "SI<NS>/BI<NB>",
where I<NS> and I<NB> are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8,
I<NS> specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and I<NB> the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
"s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively.

Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = C<(12E<lt>E<lt>9)+9> specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.


=item B<size, s>

Set the size of the output video. For the syntax of this option, check the
"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual.

If B<filename> is specified, the size is set by default to the
same size of the input file. If B<size> is set, it must contain
the size specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in
that file is centered in the larger resulting area.

If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to "320x240"
(used for a randomly generated initial grid).


=item B<stitch>

If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.


=item B<mold>

Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from B<death_color> to
B<mold_color> with a step of B<mold>. B<mold> can have a
value from 0 to 255.


=item B<life_color>

Set the color of living (or new born) cells.


=item B<death_color>

Set the color of dead cells. If B<mold> is set, this is the first color
used to represent a dead cell.


=item B<mold_color>

Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

For the syntax of these 3 color options, check the "Color" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual.

=head2 color, haldclutsrc, nullsrc, rgbtestsrc, smptebars, smptehdbars, testsrc


The C<color> source provides an uniformly colored input.

The C<haldclutsrc> source provides an identity Hald CLUT. See also
B<haldclut> filter.

The C<nullsrc> source returns unprocessed video frames. It is
mainly useful to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the
source for filters which ignore the input data.

The C<rgbtestsrc> source generates an RGB test pattern useful for
detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a red, green and blue
stripe from top to bottom.

The C<smptebars> source generates a color bars pattern, based on
the SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

The C<smptehdbars> source generates a color bars pattern, based on
the SMPTE RP 219-2002.

The C<testsrc> source generates a test video pattern, showing a
color pattern, a scrolling gradient and a timestamp. This is mainly
intended for testing purposes.

The sources accept the following parameters:


=over 4

source. For the syntax of this option, check the "Color" section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual.


=item B<level>

Specify the level of the Hald CLUT, only available in the C<haldclutsrc>
source. A level of C<N> generates a picture of C<N*N*N> by C<N*N*N>
pixels to be used as identity matrix for 3D lookup tables. Each component is
coded on a C<1/(N*N)> scale.


=item B<size, s>

Specify the size of the sourced video. For the syntax of this option, check the
"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. The default value is
"320x240".

This option is not available with the C<haldclutsrc> filter.


=item B<rate, r>

Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
I<frame_rate_num>/I<frame_rate_den>, an integer number, a floating point
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is
"25".


=item B<sar>

Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.


=item B<duration, d>

Set the video duration of the sourced video. The accepted syntax is:
	
	[-]HH[:MM[:SS[.m...]]]
	[-]S+[.m...]

Also see the the C<av_parse_time()> function.

If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video is
supposed to be generated forever.


=item B<decimals, n>

Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only available in the
C<testsrc> source.

The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the original
timestamp value multiplied by the power of 10 of the specified
value. Default value is 0.

=back


For example the following:
	
	testsrc=duration=5.3:size=qcif:rate=10


will generate a video with a duration of 5.3 seconds, with size
176x144 and a frame rate of 10 frames per second.

The following graph description will generate a red source
with an opacity of 0.2, with size "qcif" and a frame rate of 10
frames per second.
	
	color=c=red@0.2:s=qcif:r=10


If the input content is to be ignored, C<nullsrc> can be used. The
following command generates noise in the luminance plane by employing
the C<geq> filter:
	
	nullsrc=s=256x256, geq=random(1)*255:128:128

=head1 VIDEO SINKS


Below is a description of the currently available video sinks.


=head2 buffersink


Buffer video frames, and make them available to the end of the filter
graph.

This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in F<libavfilter/buffersink.h>
or the options system.

defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
parameter to C<avfilter_init_filter> for initialization.


=head2 nullsink


Null video sink: do absolutely nothing with the input video. It is
mainly useful as a template and for use in analysis / debugging
tools.



=head1 MULTIMEDIA FILTERS


Below is a description of the currently available multimedia filters.


=head2 avectorscope


Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio vector
scope.

The filter is used to measure the difference between channels of stereo
audio stream. A monoaural signal, consisting of identical left and right
signal, results in straight vertical line. Any stereo separation is visible
as a deviation from this line, creating a Lissajous figure.
If the straight (or deviation from it) but horizontal line appears this
indicates that the left and right channels are out of phase.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode, m>

Set the vectorscope mode.

Available values are:

=head2 concat


Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after the
other.

The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams. All
segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and that will
also be the number of streams at output.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<n>

Set the number of segments. Default is 2.


=item B<v>

Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of video
streams in each segment. Default is 1.


=item B<a>

Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of audio
streams in each segment. Default is 0.


=item B<unsafe>

Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different format.


=back


The filter has I<v>+I<a> outputs: first I<v> video outputs, then
I<a> audio outputs.

There are I<n>x(I<v>+I<a>) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.

Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.

For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.

All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.

Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual version
(video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):
	
	ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
	  '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
	   concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
	  -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv



=item *

Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using the
(a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:
	
	movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
	movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
	[v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video streams
do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.

=head2 ebur128


EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as input and outputs
it unchanged. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of 10Hz with the
Momentary loudness (identified by C<M>), Short-term loudness (C<S>),
Integrated loudness (C<I>) and Loudness Range (C<LRA>).

The filter also has a video output (see the I<video> option) with a real
time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the logged
message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this option is set,
unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing area contains the
short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the gauge on the right is for
the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds).

More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on
E<lt>B<http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness>E<gt>.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<video>

Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged whether this
option is set or no. The video stream will be the first output stream if
activated. Default is C<0>.


=item B<size>

Set the video size. This option is for video only. For the syntax of this
option, check the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default
and minimum resolution is C<640x480>.


=item B<meter>

Set the EBU scale meter. Default is C<9>. Common values are C<9> and
C<18>, respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any
other integer value between this range is allowed.


=item B<metadata>

Set metadata injection. If set to C<1>, the audio input will be segmented
into 100ms output frames, each of them containing various loudness information
in metadata.  All the metadata keys are prefixed with C<lavfi.r128.>.

Default is C<0>.


=item B<framelog>

Force the frame logging level.

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<info>

information logging level

=item B<verbose>

verbose logging level

=back


By default, the logging level is set to I<info>. If the B<video> or
the B<metadata> options are set, it switches to I<verbose>.


=item B<peak>

Set peak mode(s).

Available modes can be cumulated (the option is a C<flag> type). Possible
values are:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Disable any peak mode (default).

=item B<sample>

Enable sample-peak mode.

Simple peak mode looking for the higher sample value. It logs a message
for sample-peak (identified by C<SPK>).

=item B<true>

Enable true-peak mode.

If enabled, the peak lookup is done on an over-sampled version of the input
stream for better peak accuracy. It logs a message for true-peak.
(identified by C<TPK>) and true-peak per frame (identified by C<FTPK>).
This mode requires a build with C<libswresample>.

=head2 interleave, ainterleave


Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

C<interleave> works with video inputs, C<ainterleave> with audio.

These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.

Input streams must have a well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.

In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.

For example consider the case when one input is a C<select> filter
which always drop input frames. The C<interleave> filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input will send an end-of-stream signal.

Also, depending on inputs synchronization, the filters will drop
frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and
the queue is already filled.

These filters accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<nb_inputs, n>

Set the number of different inputs, it is 2 by default.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Interleave frames belonging to different streams using B<ffmpeg>:

	select='if(gt(random(0), 0.2), 1, 2)':n=2 [tmp], boxblur=2:2, [tmp] interleave


=back



=head2 perms, aperms


Set read/write permissions for the output frames.

These filters are mainly aimed at developers to test direct path in the
following filter in the filtergraph.

The filters accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<mode>

Select the permissions mode.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do nothing. This is the default.

=item B<ro>

Set all the output frames read-only.

=item B<rw>

Set all the output frames directly writable.

=item B<toggle>

Make the frame read-only if writable, and writable if read-only.

=item B<random>

Set each output frame read-only or writable randomly.

=back



=item B<seed>

Set the seed for the I<random> mode, must be an integer included between
C<0> and C<UINT32_MAX>. If not specified, or if explicitly set to
C<-1>, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best effort
basis.

=back


Note: in case of auto-inserted filter between the permission filter and the
following one, the permission might not be received as expected in that
following filter. Inserting a B<format> or B<aformat> filter before the
perms/aperms filter can avoid this problem.


=head2 select, aselect


Select frames to pass in output.

This filter accepts the following options:


=over 4



=item B<expr, e>

Set expression, which is evaluated for each input frame.

If the expression is evaluated to zero, the frame is discarded.

If the evaluation result is negative or NaN, the frame is sent to the
first output; otherwise it is sent to the output with index
C<ceil(val)-1>, assuming that the input index starts from 0.

For example a value of C<1.2> corresponds to the output with index
C<ceil(1.2)-1 = 2-1 = 1>, that is the second output.


=item B<outputs, n>

Set the number of outputs. The output to which to send the selected
frame is based on the result of the evaluation. Default value is 1.

These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
filtergraph.

C<sendcmd> must be inserted between two video filters,
C<asendcmd> must be inserted between two audio filters, but apart
from that they act the same way.

=head3 Commands syntax


A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.

An interval is specified by the following syntax:
	
	<START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>;


The time interval is specified by the I<START> and I<END> times.
I<END> is optional and defaults to the maximum time.

The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [I<START>, I<END>), that is when
the time is greater or equal to I<START> and is lesser than
I<END>.

I<COMMANDS> consists of a sequence of one or more command
specifications, separated by ",", relating to that interval.  The
syntax of a command specification is given by:
	
	[<FLAGS>] <TARGET> <COMMAND> <ARG>


I<FLAGS> is optional and specifies the type of events relating to
the time interval which enable sending the specified command, and must
be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by "+" or "|" and
enclosed between "[" and "]".

The following flags are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<enter>

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
current is.


=item B<leave>

The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the
current is not.

=back


If I<FLAGS> is not specified, a default value of C<[enter]> is
assumed.

I<TARGET> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.

I<COMMAND> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

I<ARG> is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for
the given I<COMMAND>.

Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
sequences of characters starting with C<#> until the end of line,
are ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax
follows:
	
	<COMMAND_FLAG>  ::= "enter" | "leave"
	<COMMAND_FLAGS> ::= <COMMAND_FLAG> [(+|"|")<COMMAND_FLAG>]
	<COMMAND>       ::= ["[" <COMMAND_FLAGS> "]"] <TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]
	<COMMANDS>      ::= <COMMAND> [,<COMMANDS>]
	<INTERVAL>      ::= <START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>
	<INTERVALS>     ::= <INTERVAL>[;<INTERVALS>]

The usage is very similar to the showwaves filter; see the examples in that
section.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Large window with logarithmic color scaling:
	
	showspectrum=s=1280x480:scale=log



=item *

Complete example for a colored and sliding spectrum per channel using B<ffplay>:
	
	ffplay -f lavfi 'amovie=input.mp3, asplit [a][out1];
	             [a] showspectrum=mode=separate:color=intensity:slide=1:scale=cbrt [out0]'


=back



=head2 showwaves


Convert input audio to a video output, representing the samples waves.

The filter accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<size, s>

Specify the video size for the output. For the syntax of this option, check
the "Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual. Default value
is "600x240".


=item B<mode>

Set display mode.

Available values are:

=over 4


=item B<point>

Draw a point for each sample.


=item B<line>

Draw a vertical line for each sample.


=item B<p2p>

Draw a point for each sample and a line between them.


=item B<cline>

Draw a centered vertical line for each sample.

=back


Default value is C<point>.


=item B<n>

Set the number of samples which are printed on the same column. A
larger value will decrease the frame rate. Must be a positive
integer. This option can be set only if the value for I<rate>
is not explicitly specified.


=item B<rate, r>

Set the (approximate) output frame rate. This is done by setting the
option I<n>. Default value is "25".


=item B<split_channels>

Set if channels should be drawn separately or overlap. Default value is 0.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Output the input file audio and the corresponding video representation
at the same time:
	
	amovie=a.mp3,asplit[out0],showwaves[out1]



=item *

Create a synthetic signal and show it with showwaves, forcing a
frame rate of 30 frames per second:
	
	aevalsrc=sin(1*2*PI*t)*sin(880*2*PI*t):cos(2*PI*200*t),asplit[out0],showwaves=r=30[out1]


=back



=head2 split, asplit


Split input into several identical outputs.

C<asplit> works with audio input, C<split> with video.

The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of outputs. If
unspecified, it defaults to 2.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Create two separate outputs from the same input:
	
	[in] split [out0][out1]



=item *

To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of
outputs, like in:
	
	[in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]



=item *

Create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and
one padded:
	
	[in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
	[splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
	[splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];



=item *

Create 5 copies of the input audio with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT


=back



=head2 zmq, azmq


Receive commands sent through a libzmq client, and forward them to
filters in the filtergraph.

C<zmq> and C<azmq> work as a pass-through filters. C<zmq>
must be inserted between two video filters, C<azmq> between two
audio filters.

To enable these filters you need to install the libzmq library and
headers and configure FFmpeg with C<--enable-libzmq>.

For more information about libzmq see:
E<lt>B<http://www.zeromq.org/>E<gt>

The C<zmq> and C<azmq> filters work as a libzmq server, which
receives messages sent through a network interface defined by the
B<bind_address> option.

The received message must be in the form:
	
	<TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]


I<TARGET> specifies the target of the command, usually the name of
the filter class or a specific filter instance name.

I<COMMAND> specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

I<ARG> is optional and specifies the optional argument list for the
given I<COMMAND>.

Upon reception, the message is processed and the corresponding command
is injected into the filtergraph. Depending on the result, the filter
will send a reply to the client, adopting the format:
	
	<ERROR_CODE> <ERROR_REASON>
	<MESSAGE>


I<MESSAGE> is optional.


=head3 Examples


Look at F<tools/zmqsend> for an example of a zmq client which can
be used to send commands processed by these filters.

Consider the following filtergraph generated by B<ffplay>
	
	ffplay -dumpgraph 1 -f lavfi "
	color=s=100x100:c=red  [l];
	color=s=100x100:c=blue [r];
	nullsrc=s=200x100, zmq [bg];
	[bg][l]   overlay      [bg+l];
	[bg+l][r] overlay=x=100 "


To change the color of the left side of the video, the following
command can be used:
	
	echo Parsed_color_0 c yellow | tools/zmqsend


To change the right side:
	
	echo Parsed_color_1 c pink | tools/zmqsend




=head1 MULTIMEDIA SOURCES


Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.


=head2 amovie


This is the same as B<movie> source, except it selects an audio
stream by default.



=head2 movie


Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

It accepts the following parameters:


=over 4


=item B<filename>

The name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file; it can also be a
device or a stream accessed through some protocol).


=item B<format_name, f>

Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be either
the name of a container or an input device. If not specified, the
format is guessed from I<movie_name> or by probing.


=item B<seek_point, sp>

Specifies the seek point in seconds. The frames will be output
starting from this seek point. The parameter is evaluated with
C<av_strtod>, so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS
postfix. The default value is "0".


=item B<streams, s>

Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
separated by "+". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
same order. The syntax is explained in the ``Stream specifiers''
section in the ffmpeg manual. Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify
respectively the default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default
is "dv", or "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".


=item B<stream_index, si>

Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is -1,
the most suitable video stream will be automatically selected. The default
value is "-1". Deprecated. If the filter is called "amovie", it will select
audio instead of video.


=item B<loop>

Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.
If the value is less than 1, the stream will be read again and again.
Default value is "1".

Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing timestamps.

=back


It allows overlaying a second video on top of the main input of
a filtergraph, as shown in this graph:
	
	input -----------> deltapts0 --> overlay --> output
	                                    ^
	                                    |
	movie --> scale--> deltapts1 -------+


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Skip 3.2 seconds from the start of the AVI file in.avi, and overlay it
on top of the input labelled "in":
	
	movie=in.avi:seek_point=3.2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
	[in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
	[main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]



=item *

Read from a video4linux2 device, and overlay it on top of the input
labelled "in":
	
	movie=/dev/video0:f=video4linux2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [over];
	[in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [main];
	[main][over] overlay=16:16 [out]



=item *

Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from
dvd.vob; the video is connected to the pad named "video" and the audio is
connected to the pad named "audio":
	
	movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]
